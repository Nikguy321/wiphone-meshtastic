"""check_gbc_ring.py - a Game Boy game's exit puts the I2S ring back where the heap wants it (0.9.79).

After a game, free internal RAM came back but the LARGEST block did not: 63,716 -> 32,816 on phone 1,
64,152 -> 28,732 on phone 2, for the rest of the boot. The game's setMonoOutput() (re)installs the
I2S ring (8 x 4 KB of DMA RAM) with the emulator's stacks, VRAM and audio buffer (32 KB) already at
the bottom of the phone's big free block, and IDF 3.3's heap is best fit: what is left of that block
is then smaller than the hole the old ring leaves, so the ring lands right on top of the emulator's
blocks, and at quit they free BELOW it. Phone 1's hole after quit was exactly those four blocks
(32,768 + 4 x 12 B of heap poisoning); on phone 2 music's own install moving the ring away gave
64,316 back. See Audio::reseatI2S() in WiPhone/Audio.cpp.

The fix is an ORDER in ~GbcApp and two GUARDS in Audio::reseatI2S(), in files the host suite cannot
compile, so - like tests/check_call_audio.py, whose contract engine this uses - they are pinned here
POSITIVELY:
  G1  ~GbcApp: gbcReleaseEmulator(), THEN audio->shutdown(), THEN audio->reseatI2S(), THEN
      wifiRestoreStation(). Before the release the ring is placed over the same blocks again; before
      the shutdown the codec loses its clocks while powered; after WiFi, the station's allocations
      have already taken the holes the ring should go back into.
  G2  ~GbcApp: the reseat only when startGame set the ring up (`ringReseat`) - a visit to the picker
      must not reinstall anything.
  G3  startGame: `ringReseat = true` after the setMonoOutput() that (re)installs the ring.
  G4  reseatI2S() refuses while the device is ON (audioOn) or with no driver to move (!i2sInstalled).
  G5  reseatI2S() asks installI2S(false, true) - the DEFAULT ring, FRESH - and then stops it.
      A non-fresh install finds the game's ring matching and returns: nothing would move.
  G6  reseatI2S()'s i2s_stop() only on an installed driver (IDF 3.3 dereferences NULL otherwise).
  G7  i2s_driver_install()/i2s_driver_uninstall() are called NOWHERE but Audio::installI2S(): its
      cache (and so the reseat, which goes through it) is only true while that holds.
  G8  Audio::start() refuses with no driver (after one reinstall) BEFORE it powers the codec or calls
      i2s_start(): a failed install - the reseat's among them - leaves none, IDF 3.3's i2s_start()
      dereferences NULL, and playMusic() calls turnOn() before it installs its own ring.
  G9  Audio::shutdown()'s i2s_stop() only with a driver installed (the same NULL, for every teardown).
  G10 ~GbcApp's shutdown() asks `soundStarted` and NOT `soundOn`: the emu thread clears soundOn when
      I2S starves and leaves the device ON, and skipping the shutdown there made the reseat refuse.
  G11 startGame: `soundStarted = soundOn` right after `soundOn = audio->start()`.
Review 3 (A2) made the driver a precondition of EVERY writer, not just start() (a reinstall can fail
with the device ON - a pop, the ring or a call swapping music's ring out - and turnOn() skipped
start() then):
  G12 turnOn() refuses with no driver (after one reinstall) BEFORE its `if (!audioOn ...)`: whether
      or not the device is on.
  G13 Audio::loop() returns with no driver before its first writer (LocalPcm, RtpStream, Record and
      the microphone reach i2s_write/i2s_read, which dereference NULL).
  G14 installI2S() forgets the geometry with the driver (i2sRx, i2sBufs, i2sLen) when it uninstalls:
      a stale i2sRx let the mic block read a NULL driver.
  G15 playPop() (the pcm overload), playRingtone() and playRtpStream() refuse with no driver after
      their setters and before turnOn(); playPop's refusal names it and restore()s its snapshot.
And (A6) a ring installed with the device OFF is left stopped, the way shutdown() leaves one:
  G16 installI2S(): i2s_stop() inside the successful install, only when !audioOn.
And (review 3, R3-4 on R3-2) those refusals only protect the writers behind them:
  G17 playChunk(), i2s_read() and the music feed's pass() are called nowhere but Audio::loop() (after
      its G13 return), playSample() nowhere but playChunk() (and the caller-less playSampleChunk(), which
      nothing may call), and i2s_write() nowhere but playSample(),
      music's AudioMusicI2s sink and the Game Boy's emuThread (behind soundOn = audio->start(), G8).
      The sink is reached only through the feed's three public writers - pass(), start() and
      closeRing() - so each of those has ONE allowed site, and `s_musicI2s` is named only at start():
  G18 Audio::ceasePlayback()'s feed->closeRing() sits inside `if (i2sInstalled)`.
  G19 Audio::playMusic() refuses with no driver (its `!i2sInstalled || i2sBufs != MUSIC_DMA_BUFS`
      check) BEFORE feed->start(), whose prefill writes the ring.
      🛑 G17 as 772b855 committed it claimed "every writer behind a refusal" while ceasePlayback()'s
      closeRing() had none: after F1 resumed a track inside the Recorder and its Record setters' three
      reinstalls all failed (an exhausted internal heap), the next F1 or any shutdown() topped up the
      ring through IDF 3.3's NULL p_i2s_obj[0] - a LoadProhibited panic. The allowance was the whole
      AudioMusicI2s class, and only feed->pass() call sites were restricted; a closeRing(), a start()
      or a direct s_musicI2s.write() anywhere, or playMusic()'s start() moved above its install check
      (the pre-fix crash shape), all passed.

MUTATIONS then breaks each one in the REAL source, one at a time, and requires its own contract to
report it (tests/check_wifi_restore.py's pattern): a guard rewritten so its mutation no longer
matches fails too, so the mutation gets updated with the guard.
