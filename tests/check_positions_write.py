"""check_positions_write.py - no sync carrier may write, or reach for, a reading position.

THE HARD RULE (docs/booksync-simple-plan.md; Nick: "we can't let it screw up the position people
are at in their own wiphones after they update"): an update or a sync never moves the place someone
is at on their own WiPhone. Every carrier - LoRa (booksync.cpp, booksync_inbox.cpp), KOSync
(kosync.cpp, kosync_sync.cpp), and whatever comes next (the WiFi broadcast on UDP 8083, ESP-NOW
"Nearby") - ends at the same sync CARD, and only the person's "Go there" on that card writes a
position: BooksApp::applyPending() (app_books.cpp), which turns the offered FRACTION into a place
with epubLocate() and commits it with savePosition(true) -> store->put(). A carrier that could call
any of those, or open positions.cbs itself, would be one bug away from moving a reader's place with
nobody pressing anything.

test_kosync's golden_positions.h proves the PARSER gives every fixture the same place as 0.9.78; it
cannot see who calls the writer. This can. The identifiers are matched on comment-and-string-blanked
source (check_wifi_restore.py's strip_code, brace and paren matching), because comments in kosync.h
and kosync_sync.h mention positions.cbs and applyPending() on purpose - a guard that trips on its
own documentation is one people learn to ignore (check_menu_keys.py's lesson). The file NAME is
looked for with comments blanked but strings KEPT: the only ways code names a file are a string
literal and the BOOKS_POS_FILE macro, and both are banned in a carrier.

  (a) none of the CARRIER files (CARRIERS below) references savePosition(, booksSaveOpenPosition(,
      applyPending(, epubLocate(, store->put( or BOOKS_POS_FILE in code, nor positions.cbs in code
      or in a string. 🛑 A NEW CARRIER FILE (UDP 8083, ESP-NOW) GOES ON THAT LIST the day it is
      created, or this guard does not cover it - the list is the contract's reach.
  (b) in app_books.cpp: store->put( has exactly ONE call site and it is inside
      BooksApp::savePosition(); applyPending( is CALLED from exactly ONE place - the sync card's
      OK branch (`case BOOKS_SYNCCARD:` ... `if (LOGIC_BUTTON_OK(event))`) in
      BooksApp::processEvent(), and there only after the arming guard
      (`if (millis() - syncCardMs < BOOKS_SYNCCARD_ARM_MS) { return ...; }` - a press inside the
      window that raised the card is swallowed); the reader menu's "Go to X's place" row
      (`case BOOKS_MENU_PENDING:`) only ENTERS that card state (enterState(BOOKS_SYNCCARD)) and
      never calls applyPending() itself. And a synced place is written only inside applyPending():
      epubLocate( - the one call that turns an offered fraction into a spine and offset - is
      called in app_books.cpp only inside applyPending(), which commits with savePosition(true).
      What function_body can NOT say: that no other savePosition(true) writes a synced place. The
      other calls (page turns, chapter jumps, closes, undo, the OK-to-menu flush) write the
      reader's OWN place, which is what they are for; none of them can see `pending` through
      epubLocate, and that is the property pinned.
  (c) a self-test plants each banned spelling into a scratch copy of a carrier (in memory), and a
      second store->put(, a second applyPending() call, an epubLocate() outside applyPending, a
      missing arming guard and a menu row that applies directly into a scratch app_books.cpp, and
      requires the guard to trip; a mention in a comment, or an identifier inside a string, must
      NOT.

Wired into tests/run_tests.sh next to the other source guards; exit 1 fails the suite.
