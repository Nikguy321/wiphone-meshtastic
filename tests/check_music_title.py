"""check_music_title.py - the Now playing title is drawn only when the track changes, over cleared strips.

Nick on 0.9.79 (2026-09-26, the first listening pass): after the side button's "next", the title read
"Pulsirt Explorer" - "Pulse" painted over "Space Explorer" - with a stray letter on the line below. The
1 Hz refresh redrew the two title lines over themselves with no clear: fine while the track stayed the
same (the face is proportional, so the new glyphs cover only their own pixels), wrong the moment it
changed, and a one-line title left the second line of the two-line title before it standing. Every OTHER
line of that screen already clears its strip first (the comment above them explains why trailing spaces
do not work). drawNowPlaying() lives behind the LCD, so the host suite cannot run it; this pins the
shape, POSITIVELY, on comment/string-blanked source (tests/check_wifi_restore.py's helpers):

  1. MusicApp::drawNowPlaying() has exactly one `if (cur != titleShown)` block;
  2. that block clears BOTH title strips first: a fillRect( whose height is `2 * lh`, BEFORE the first
     guiDrawEllipsized(;
  3. every guiDrawEllipsized( of the function (the two title lines) is INSIDE that block - nothing draws
     a title over the last one;
  4. the block records what it drew (`titleShown = cur`), and the whole-panel clear (`!nowClean`) forgets
     it (`titleShown = -2`) so a blanked panel gets its title back;
  5. the constructor starts at `titleShown = -2`.

A self-test plants the three hand mutations that reproduce the bug into a scratch copy and shows each trips.
