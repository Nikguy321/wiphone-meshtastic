"""check_wifi_restore.py - nothing outside Networks.cpp may bring the WiFi station back by itself.

Every site that switched the radio off, or lent it to a hotspot, gives it back through
wifiRestoreStation() (WiPhone/Networks.cpp, deciding in WiPhone/wifi_policy.h). Until 0.9.79
each site asked its own subset of the owner's state - the Game Boy's exit the off switch alone,
the loop's retry neither the game nor the switch, the Settings toggles nothing at all (a bare
esp_wifi_start(), which restarts whatever mode the DRIVER last had) - and between them they put
WiFi back on behind "off" after every game on a phone with no saved network.

So this fails the suite on the spellings that start or rejoin the station, anywhere in
WiPhone/*.{cpp,h,ino} except Networks.cpp (which owns them):

    esp_wifi_start(      a bare driver start: the DRIVER's last mode, maybe AP
    esp_wifi_connect(    a join on whatever config the driver holds
    WiFi.reconnect(      the same
    WiFi.begin(          ANY form: no arguments rejoins the driver's config, and (ssid, pwd) is
                         a join that skips connectToWiFi()'s game/hotspot refusal - the tree's
                         one join lives there. Both start the station first.
    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA)  also WIFI_MODE_STA / WIFI_AP_STA / WIFI_MODE_APSTA
    WiFi.enableSTA(true)

A ban only catches a NEW bad spelling. The review of 0.9.79 reverted six of its fixes together in
a scratch copy - the loop retry's gate, the boot restore, xferStart's game refusal, Settings >
WiFi's hotspot stop, its exit restore, connectToWiFi's refusal - and this file and the policy
suite both stayed green: deleting a guard spells nothing banned. So CONTRACTS below also states,
POSITIVELY, where each guard must be: "every connectToPreferred() in loop() sits inside an `if`
whose condition asks wifiStationWanted()", "xferStart refuses on gGbcActive before transportUp",
and so on. Matched on the same comment-and-string-blanked text, by brace and paren matching
rather than line grepping (check_menu_keys.py's lesson: wrapped calls are where line patterns go
blind). A contract that cannot find its function fails too - a rename must update it, not
silently retire it.

Comments and string/char literals are blanked first (a guard that trips on its own
documentation is one people learn to ignore - check_menu_keys.py found that out). The linker
wrappers in cpu_clock.cpp (`__wrap_esp_wifi_start`, `__real_esp_wifi_start`) are not calls
anyone makes and do not match: the pattern needs a word boundary before `esp_wifi_`.
A self-test runs first, so a pattern that has quietly stopped matching fails loudly.

THE CORE'S AUTO-RECONNECT AND THE LOOP'S RETRY (the 0.9.79 integration review, R1 and R2). Two more
ways the station came back without anyone asking, pinned the same way:

  R1  arduino-esp32's event task answers a NO_AP_FOUND with `WiFi.disconnect(); WiFi.begin();`
      while getAutoReconnect() - and begin() is mode(current | STA). So the flag is held off before
      every line that takes the station away (a hotspot's WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP), a game's disconnect,
      Networks::disable()) and released before the station is given back. `setAutoReconnect(` is
      BANNED outside Networks.cpp, and inside it lives only in wifiAutoReconnectApply(), which
      computes the flag from the holds (wifi_policy.h) - saved copies did not nest.
      `power sleep` refuses on the RADIO (cpuClockRadioOn), not the switch.
  R2  the loop's join retry may not begin within 10 s of any other join (wifiRetryMayBegin), and
      the loop reads join ages with wifiJoinAgeMs, never `now - stamp`: a restore earlier in the
      same pass stamps AFTER the loop read `now`, and the subtraction called it 49 days old.

MUTATIONS then removes each of those guards from the REAL source, one at a time, and requires the
check to fail - the review's experiment (a guard deleted, the suite still green), kept.
