/*
 * test_layout.cpp — paging a chapter into screens.
 *
 * There is no wire format to match here, so these are behaviour tests. They target the ways
 * a reader loses your place without saying anything: a word that vanishes at a page break, a
 * word shown twice, a page that opens on a blank row, a multi-byte character sliced in half,
 * and going BACK a page landing somewhere other than where you came from.
 *
 * The width stub is deliberately crude — every ASCII byte is 6px wide, every continuation
 * byte 0 — so an expected line break can be worked out by hand and a failure means the RULE
 * is wrong rather than the font.
