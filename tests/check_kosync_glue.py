"""check_kosync_glue.py - the KOSync home client never waits on a name, and a re-read of
kosync.txt nobody asked for never wipes the window's warnings (0.9.79).

test_kosync pins the PURE half of home= by name - the mDNS query and answer bytes, the
lookup/fallback/reached/gave-up rules (kosyncHomePlan and friends), and kosyncReloadClears - and a
review's 19 hand-made mutants of kosync.cpp were caught all but once (an equivalent one). But BOTH
bugs the 0.9.79 work fixed were in the GLUE, in files the host suite cannot compile:

  - kosync_sync.cpp called resolveDomain() at the start of every home job: the loop blocked
    >= 0.5 s on each book open and close, and a .local name never resolved at all;
  - the window's `!` warnings were cleared on the re-read of kosync.txt that Books makes on EVERY
    entry (app_books.cpp), i.e. on the way to the one screen that shows them.

The same review put resolveDomain(T->cfg.home) back at the start of the job and changed both
Books re-reads to kosyncReloadConfig(true) in a scratch copy: test_kosync stayed 1984/1984 and
every check_*.py guard exited 0. So each guard is a POSITIVE contract here, matched on
comment-and-string-blanked source by brace and paren matching (check_wifi_restore.py's helpers):

  1. no blocking resolver in kosync_sync.cpp: no resolveDomain(, hostByName(, gethostbyname(,
     getaddrinfo(, queryHost(, mdns_query_*(, netconn_gethostbyname(, and no tcpip_callback( or
     tcpip_api_call( (both post and WAIT on the tcpip thread's mailbox);
  2. every kosyncReloadConfig() call but ONE takes no argument (or false) - the two Books
     re-reads, the implicit one in kosyncConfigured() - and the header's default stays false;
  3. serial `kosync reload` is that one: it passes true;
  4. every recvfrom()/recv() in kosync_sync.cpp passes MSG_DONTWAIT, lookupPoll() reads its
     socket that way, dns_gethostbyname() is called only inside dnsStart(), and dnsStart() is
     only ever HANDED to tcpip_callback_with_block(dnsStart, <tag>, 0) - never called on the loop;
  5. kosyncWindowOpen()'s new-window branch (the else of `if (sameBook)`) calls
     clearWindowProblems(), and nothing else in that function does (an extended window for the
     same book keeps its warnings);
  6. and the rest of the "what clears the warnings" rule: clearWindowProblems() is called only
     from kosyncWindowOpen(), reloadDone() - there only `if (kosyncReloadClears(asked, ...))` -
     and kosyncReloadConfig() - there only `if (asked)`; kosyncReloadConfig() passes `asked`
     through to every reloadDone(); and s_other/s_unauth, and the window's PUT log (T->puts),
     are zeroed nowhere but clearWindowProblems().

The integration review's three KOSync findings were glue too (test_kosync pins their pure half:
kosyncOfferFill, kosyncParkPending/kosyncOfferAnswered, the PUT log):

  7. KS-1 - a home record is judged against the last move AS OF THE ASK: evaluateOffer() fills
     its KosyncOfferIn only through kosyncOfferFill(&in, &g, thenSend, ..., b->movedAt, ...) -
     the explicit flag is `thenSend`, the asked stamp is the job's snapshot - and nothing in
     kosync_sync.cpp assigns myMovedAt; kosyncNotePosition() never refreshes s_waitBook's stamp
     (its notePlace(s_waitBook, ...) passes 0). A page turned while the pull on open was on its
     way used to hide the X4's newer place ("older than your last page turn").
  8. KS-2 - "declined" means ANSWERED: nothing in kosync_sync.cpp assigns offeredSig (it was set
     and saved the moment a park succeeded); evaluateOffer() asks kosyncParkPending() and every
     `return false` there (= "go on and PUT ours") sits under an `if` that says `!parkLive`;
     app_books.cpp calls kosyncCardAnswered(pendingId) in applyPending() and in the
     LOGIC_BUTTON_BACK branch that retires the parks, and nowhere else calls it.
  9. KS-3 - a reader's second id is not another book: kosyncWindowServe() logs `if (o.gotPut)`
     with kosyncPutLogOwn() and `if (o.otherDoc)` with kosyncPutLogOther(), and
     kosyncProblemLine() counts the other-book PUTs with kosyncPutLogDifferent().
 10. KS-2's rule for EVERY push (the repair round): clientStep()'s KS_CONNECT block refuses a job's
     FIRST PUT - `if (!s_phaseGet && s_w->sent == 0 && parkAwaitsAnswer(...)) { finishJob(...);
     return; }`, after the `!mayUseNetwork` hold and before startConnect() - and parkAwaitsAnswer()
     asks kosyncParkPending() WITH the local key. A close's push queued behind the pull on open
     used to PUT our place over the X4's the pull had just parked, before anyone saw the card.
 11. N1 - a WiFi join in progress is not "off WiFi": joinInProgress() is the join-age test
     (wifiJoinAgeMs(now, lastWifiConnectAttemptMs()) < KOSYNC_JOIN_WAIT_MS), and clientStep()'s
     idle branch holds the ask on it before dropping it. Integration review 3 (R3-3, KOS-N1a)
     found the hold incomplete, so also: the idle branch's `if (!mayUseNetwork)` hold zeroes
     s_joinWaitSinceMs (a wait begun before a game made the join after it look 60 s old, and the
     ask was dropped on its first pass); the wait starts nowhere but in the idle branch's
     `if (joinInProgress(now))`; KS_RESOLVE, KS_RETRY and KS_CONNECT each give up "not on WiFi"
     only under `if (!heldOffWifi(mayUseNetwork, now))`, KS_CONNECT's check comes before
     startConnect(); and heldOffWifi() holds while a game has the radio OR a join is coming, going
     back to KS_IDLE with the ask KEPT (dropSocket, no finishJob, no want cleared).
     The same review's R3-4 then showed contract 11 pinned the SHAPE and not the parts: replacing the
     60 s cap with `if (true)` (a phone out of range held the ask for ever) and deleting
     `!xferUsingAP() && wifiStationWanted() &&` both survived. So also: joinInProgress() is ONE `&&`
     chain holding every term (JOIN_TERMS); the wait returns only under the cap, starts only
     `if (!s_joinWaitSinceMs)`, and is zeroed on the way past it before the ask can be dropped.
     Its verification then made the cap 0xFFFFFFFFu through the #define and contract 11 held (it
     pinned the comparison, not the constant), so the two #defines are read too: plain decimal
     literals, each defined once, KOSYNC_JOIN_WAIT_MS < KOSYNC_JOIN_WAIT_MAX_MS <= 120 s.

A contract that cannot find its function fails too - a rename must update it, not silently
retire it. A self-test replays the pre-fix shapes first, then REMOVES each guard from the real
sources one at a time (the review's experiment among them) and requires its contract to trip.
