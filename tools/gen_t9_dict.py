"""Generate WiPhone/src/assets/t9_dict.h — the flash-resident T9 word table.

WHY THIS SHAPE
--------------
The phone has ~15-20 KB of free INTERNAL heap in steady state, and an allocation failure
inside `new` throws with nothing catching it (see the note on MenuOption in GUI.h). So the
dictionary must cost ZERO heap. It does: this emits a `static const` table, PROGMEM is a
no-op on ESP32, and .rodata is memory-mapped, so every read is a plain pointer dereference
straight out of flash with no copy. The 3.2 MB DROM window is the ceiling, not the ~20 KB heap.

WHY THERE ARE NO FREQUENCIES IN THE OUTPUT
------------------------------------------
Rank is the STORAGE ORDER, not a stored field. Words are sorted by (digit key, then descending
frequency), so "most likely candidate first" and "press DOWN for the next one" both fall out of
an index into a contiguous run. That costs zero bytes — and it also means the shipped artefact
is nothing but an ordered list of ordinary English words: no counts, no n-grams, no contiguous
source text. That matters for provenance as much as for size.

WHY SORTED BY DIGIT KEY
-----------------------
The digit key is RECOMPUTABLE from the word (a/b/c -> 2 ... w/x/y/z -> 9), so it is never
stored either. Sorting by the key STRING makes both lookups a contiguous run:
  exact match   ("228" -> cat, bat, act...)  = the run where key == the typed digits
  completions   ("228" -> cats, cattle...)   = the run where key startswith the typed digits
One ordering, one binary search, both behaviours.

APOSTROPHES
-----------
"don't" is keyed as if it were "dont" — the apostrophe is skipped when computing the key but
kept in the word that gets inserted. That is what the old phones did: you type d-o-n-t and get
"don't" without reaching for the symbols row.

SHORT WORDS ARE FILTERED BY RANK, NOT BY A DICTIONARY
-----------------------------------------------------
🛑 --short-len IS 2, NOT 3, AND THAT MATTERS. At 3 this filter removed 990 of the 1,115
three-letter words and left 125: "cat", "bat", "cop", "bus", "cup", "art", "cry", "sat",
"mat", "tip", "gym", "pop" and "pub" were all UNTYPABLE, and 401 of the 512 three-digit keys
matched nothing at all. The worked example three paragraphs down — 228 -> cat, bat, act —
was describing a table that did not contain cat or bat. The reasoning below is sound for
TWO letters and was wrongly extended to three; a three-letter English word is common enough
that rank cannot separate it from an initialism, and the initialisms that get in (bff, omg,
fbi, dna) are mostly things people type anyway.

A subtitle corpus\'s two-letter tokens are mostly initialisms and letter-spellings
— tv, dr, pm, cd, uk, hq, iq, em, ll, ls — and they are poison precisely because they land on
the SHORT keys, which are the ones people hit most. But a genuine short English word is by
definition frequent, so ranking separates them for free: at a cutoff of 1,000 the two-letter
survivors are exactly the real ones, and at 2,000 the initialisms and first names return.
Hence --short-max-rank. It needs no curated list and it works the same way for any language.

🛑 DO NOT PASS /usr/share/dict/web2 TO --allow. It was tried and it is the wrong KIND of list.
web2 is Webster\'s Second — HEADWORDS only — so it rejects every plural and inflection
("things", "years", "guys", "minutes", "women") and, remarkably, does not contain "has" at
all, while it DOES contain "ba", "ca" and "aa". Measured: it dropped 459 of the 3,000 most
frequent English words. --allow is for an INFLECTED word list (SCOWL and friends); given a
headword dictionary it removes the good words and keeps the junk.
