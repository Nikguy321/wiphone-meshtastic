"""Serial capture that CANNOT be killed by a transient port problem.

⚠ The previous version died the moment anything else touched the port — pyserial raises
"device reports readiness to read but returned no data (multiple access on port?)" — and it
took the crash we were waiting for with it. Any exception now means reopen and carry on;
losing a few bytes beats losing the backtrace.

⚠ NOTHING ELSE MAY OPEN THIS PORT while this runs. Route commands through /tmp/wiphone.cmd
instead: write a line to that file and this process types it for you.
