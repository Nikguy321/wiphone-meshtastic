#                                              #    (never its streamed ones)
#   cardday.sh phone2 pull /Volumes/WIPHONE    # 2. OLD card -> a full backup + its tiles into the master
#   cardday.sh phone2 push /Volumes/NEWCARD    # 3. that backup + the WHOLE master onto the new card
#   cardday.sh covey push                      # 4. whatever COVEY lacks, over SSH, into its
#                                              #    downloaded tree

#
# Never deletes a tile, at either end, and every step is re-runnable: a tile already on the
# card at the right length is skipped, a PNG already in the master is kept (an original beats
# a tile that has been through RGB565; the covey pull promotes with a hard link, which cannot
# replace one), and the backup is an --ignore-existing rsync. The only thing removed is the
# covey pull's own staging copies in <master>/.incoming.
#
# CARDDAY_MASTER, CARDDAY_CARDS and CARDDAY_COVEY_HOST override the master tree, the card
# backups and the ssh host.
