"""Build a T9 EXTRA dictionary — the user's own vocabulary, for the SD card.

WHY THIS IS A FILE ON THE CARD AND NOT COMPILED IN
--------------------------------------------------
Three reasons, in order of how much they matter:

1. Nothing third-party ends up in the distributed firmware. The webflasher installs the same
   image for everyone, and one person's BattleTech vocabulary has no business in a stranger's
   phone. It also means the licence question never arises: the words stay on the card of the
   person who wanted them.
2. Adding words costs a file copy, not a reflash.
3. It generalises. This is not "a BattleTech build", it is "bring your own words" — ham radio
   callsigns, medical terms, place names, a team roster.

The cost is one SD read at boot. That is deliberately NOT on the keypress path: reading a
dictionary per keystroke is exactly the 1.5 s freeze this firmware has fought before.

FORMAT
------
Plain UTF-8 text, one lowercase word per line, ALREADY SORTED by keypad digit key and then
by descending relevance. The phone does not sort it — it binary-searches it exactly as it
searches the built-in table, so the order in this file IS the candidate order. A hand-edited
file that is out of order will simply fail to find some words; it cannot crash the phone.

The words always rank BELOW the built-in English ones, because the engine searches the main
table first and appends this run after it. That is the behaviour you want from jargon: there
when you need it, never in the way.

INPUT
-----
Wiki page titles, one per line (see tools/fetch_sarna_titles.py), or any plain word list.
Words already in the built-in dictionary are dropped — they are already reachable.

USAGE
-----
    python3 tools/gen_t9_extra.py \\
        --titles tools/t9-corpus/sarna-titles.txt \\
        --exclude-freq tools/t9-corpus/en_50k.txt \\
