# Run after `pio run`. The four parts and their offsets are the standard ESP32 layout this
# board flashes with (the same offsets `pio run -t upload` uses):
#   0x1000   bootloader (dio/80m — matches board_build.flash_mode/f_flash in platformio.ini)
#   0x8000   partition table
#   0xe000   boot_app0 (OTA data — selects the app slot)
#   0x10000  the application
#
# ⚠ Committing every build's binaries would bloat the repo forever. Commit them when a
# release is CUT, or (better, at go-live) publish binaries as GitHub Release assets and
# point the manifest at those URLs — see docs/webflasher-plan.md.

# ⚠ ONE MERGED IMAGE, patched by esptool itself — not the four raw parts. This is the
# lesson of the first field test (black screen, boot loop): `pio upload` runs esptool
# with --flash_size detect, which PATCHES THE BOOTLOADER HEADER on the wire to 16MB; the
# raw SDK bootloader says 4MB, and a 4MB-believing bootloader rejects the 16MB partition
# layout and reset-loops. merge_bin applies exactly the same header patching (and fixes
# the appended hash), so the browser writes what the cable would have written.

# 🛑 NEVER WRITE OVER NVS. merge_bin pads the gap between the partition table and boot_app0
# with 0xFF — and that gap IS the nvs partition (0x9000, 20 KB). Written from offset 0, the
# one merged image ERASED every user's NVS on every web-flasher install through 0.9.78: the
# mesh identity key (other nodes then flag a MISMATCH and DMs to the phone fail until they
# clear nodes — seen on phone 2 after phone 1 was flashed this way, 2026-09-25), the booksync
# passcode and device name, the KOSync last-move memo, the WiFi driver's calibration. So the
# patched image is cut into two parts that step AROUND nvs (read from the partition table
# inside the image, not assumed): the bootloader + table, then boot_app0 + the app. otadata
# (boot_app0) is still written on purpose: it points the bootloader at app0, where the app goes.
# tools/webflasher_split.py does the cut (tests/check_webflasher_split.py pins it) and prints the
# parts' offsets last, as JSON, for the manifest.
