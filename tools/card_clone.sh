# card_clone.sh - copy a WiPhone SD card to the Mac, or a copy back onto a card.
#
#   tools/card_clone.sh pull /Volumes/WIPHONE ~/wiphone-cards/phone1     # card -> folder
#   tools/card_clone.sh push ~/wiphone-cards/phone1 /Volumes/NEWCARD      # folder -> card
#
# Everything on the card is copied - configs, roms, books, photos, messages, the maps - except
# what macOS itself leaves on a FAT volume (._sidecars, .DS_Store, .Spotlight-V100, .fseventsd,
# .Trashes). Nothing is ever deleted at the destination, so a push onto a card that already has
# files adds to them. Both directions end with a count of files on each side so a copy that
# stopped early cannot pass for a finished one.
#
# The card must be FAT32 (the phone does not read exFAT). A fresh 32 GB card comes that way;
# a card over 32 GB does not, and needs `diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 WIPHONE MBRFormat diskN`
# first (look the disk number up with `diskutil list` - it is a card, not your Mac).
#
# Copying is rsync with -rt: FAT32 has no owners or permissions to keep, and the timestamps
# are kept to the 2 s FAT allows. Eject with `diskutil eject` before pulling the card.
