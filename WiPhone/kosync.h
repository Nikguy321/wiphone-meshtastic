/*
 * kosync.h — the KOSync protocol (KOReader's reading-position sync), the pure half.
 *
 * KOSync is what KOReader, the Xteink X4's CrossPoint firmware and COVEY all speak: a tiny
 * HTTP+JSON protocol that moves ONE number per book — a whole-book percentage — keyed by a
 * document id. On the WiPhone it rides beside LoRa booksync, never instead of it:
 *
 *   the WINDOW  the phone serves KOSync for one book for a few minutes, on its own hotspot
 *               'WiPhone-Books' (192.168.4.1) in the woods, or on its WiFi address at home.
 *               An X4 joins and syncs against it. See kosync_sync.h.
 *   the CLIENT  at home, the phone pushes/pulls its place to/from the configured server
 *               (COVEY) over the WiFi it is already on. It never joins anything.
 *
 * Everything here is plain C++ with no Arduino headers — formatting, JSON, headers, the
 * server's routing and answers, the window's clock, the config file — so tests/test_kosync.cpp
 * compiles these exact bytes on a Mac. What CANNOT be tested there (sockets, the radio, the
 * card) lives in kosync_sync.cpp and is kept as thin as it can be.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE WIRE (contract §1 + §7, pinned by tools/gen_kosync_vectors.py)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *   GET  /users/auth                 200 {"authorized":"OK"} | 401
 *   GET  /syncs/progress/<document>  200 {document,percentage,progress,device,device_id,
 *                                    timestamp} | 200 {} for a document we do not know | 401
 *   PUT  /syncs/progress             body {document,progress,percentage,device,device_id}
 *                                    -> 200 {"document":..,"timestamp":<server unix s>} | 401
 *   GET  /healthcheck                200 {"state":"OK"} (no auth)
 *   POST /users/create               402 (registration is off: one user, from the config file)
 *
 *   Clients send x-auth-user: <user> and x-auth-key: <MD5(password), lower-case hex>; servers
 *   check those two and nothing else. Our clients always send Accept:
 *   application/vnd.koreader.v1+json (and Content-Type: application/json on a PUT); our
 *   server never requires it.
 *
 * 🛑 AN UNKNOWN DOCUMENT IS `200 {}`, NOT A 404 (contract §7.1 — the reference server's own
 *    answer; KOReader treats anything else as an error). CrossPoint reads {} as "0 %, nobody
 *    has synced this yet", which is exactly true.
 * ⚠ `progress` (KOReader's XPath) is sent EMPTY and ignored on read: this reader has no
 *    XPath to give, and faking one would move a KOReader device to the wrong place. A
 *    KOReader device cannot be MOVED by a percentage-only record; it can still send to us.
