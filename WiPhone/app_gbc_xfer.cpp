 * Robustness notes (learned on hardware):
 * - WebServer::handleClient() processes an entire POST synchronously in the
 *   main loop, so a big upload keeps the loop busy for many seconds. The idle
 *   task starves and the task watchdog reboots the phone. The upload/download
 *   handlers therefore delay(1) periodically to feed it.
 * - The upload page sends files ONE PER REQUEST, sequentially. One giant
 *   multipart POST with several files maximized the blocking window (reboots)
 *   and gave no per-file feedback (browser looked frozen).
 * - The server does NOT filter by extension: `accept` is only a hint to the
 *   browser's file picker. That is deliberate and has already earned its keep —
 *   it is how a 5 MB EPUB reached a phone whose firmware only knew about ROMs.

 * is up the CPU is PINNED at full speed (240 MHz until 0.9.79; 160 now, since WiFi is up
 * and cpu_clock.cpp may not re-lock the PLL under it) and the idle tick runs 5x faster - roughly
 * DOUBLE idle current - and it also stretches the screen sleep timeout to 10 minutes.
 * Nothing ever released that. There was no idle timeout, no client-gone timeout, no
 * WiFi-loss timeout: it stayed on until something called xferStop().
 *
 * That was survivable while the ONLY way to start it was a transfer SCREEN, because
 * every such screen calls xferStop() from its destructor - the server could not
 * outlive its owner. `up on` / `up on books` (serial_cmd.cpp) start it HEADLESS, with
 * no owner at all, and nothing to press Back on.
 *
 * MEASURED, in /tmp/wiphone-serial.log on the affected phone: `up on books`, last file
 * landed at up=14min, then 328 consecutive health samples reading cpu=240MHz with
 * scr=0 until up=92min. Eighty-two minutes at double idle draw with the screen off,
 * ended only because `up off` was typed by hand.
 *
 * So it now stops itself. The window is generous on purpose - this is a safety net for
 * a FORGOTTEN server, not a policy on slow uploads - and any traffic at all defers it,
 * so a browser sitting on the page between files is never cut off mid-batch. */

 *
 * MEASURED (this hardware, fast LAN, docs/upload-redesign-brief.md): a whole-file
 * POST lets TCP run at line rate and the WiFi driver floods internal heap with RX
 * buffers below the application — 14 KB → 868 bytes in seconds. Graded probes put
 * numbers on it: a 4 KB body costs NOTHING beyond the ~10 KB request machinery, an
 * 8 KB body dips 4 KB further, 16 KB grinds the largest block to 636 BYTES, and a
 * vanished client mid-POST wedged the whole main loop (the flooded RX window kept
 * the FIN undeliverable, and the parser's read loop spins while `connected()`).
 *
 * So the page now sends ONE small piece per request and waits for the ack before
 * the next departs. That bounds the radio's burst at the piece size BY
 * CONSTRUCTION — no breaker or backpressure on the happy path — and it bounds the
 * wedge too: a piece is smaller than the TCP window, so the window can never fill
 * and a dead client's FIN always gets through. The protocol (offsets, CRC,
 * idempotence, the resync rule) lives in chunk_proto.h, host-tested.
 *
 * The file stays OPEN across pieces and bytes gather in the same 32 KB PSRAM block
 * the legacy path uses — SD sees the identical few-big-writes pattern that fixed
 * the mid-upload network dropouts. An acked piece is therefore in PSRAM or on the
 * card, never lost EXCEPT to a reboot; the client's resync (`GET /chunk`) covers
 * that. The buffer belongs to whichever path has a file open — the two STARTs
 * finalize each other, so the paths cannot interleave mid-file. */

/* ── THE RAW TRANSPORT (port 8081) — why a second server exists at all ────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-20/21 on hardware: the framework WebServer costs ~10 KB of
 * internal-heap transient and ~1.6-2 KB of fragmentation PER REQUEST, and every
 * request is its own TCP connection (the library hardcodes Connection: close)
 * whose TIME_WAIT pcb haunts the heap for 120 s. At one 4 KB piece per request a
 * book is hundreds of requests, and two real runs — unpaced AND paced to 150 ms —
 * both ground the largest block to ~5 K and died flapping. Pacing does not fix a
 * per-request cost.
 *
 * So the chunk protocol gets a transport built for it: ONE TCP connection carries
 * the whole batch (keep-alive), requests are parsed by a ~150-line incremental
 * state machine pumped from the main loop (never blocks: reads only what is
 * available, with a deadline for dead clients), bodies are RAW bytes read straight
 * into the PSRAM block at OUR pace. In-flight data is bounded by the TCP window
 * (5,744 B) AND by stop-and-wait, so the RX flood that started all this is
 * impossible by construction, and per-request heap cost is ZERO — no Strings, no
 * HTTPUpload, no new connections. The verdicts, the store, and the commit path are
 * the same chunk_proto.h + chunkOpenFor/chunkCommit the WebServer path uses; that
 * path stays as the fallback (and the page probes 8081 and falls back by itself).
 *
 * CORS: the page lives on port 80, so 8081 is cross-origin. Pieces are sent as
 * text/plain (a CORS-simple request — no preflight in any browser that matters)
 * and every reply carries Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *; OPTIONS is answered
 * anyway for the browsers that ask first. */

 * MACHINERY — not the page bytes; sendContent_P changed nothing — costs a ~10 KB
 * internal-heap transient per fresh connection, which from a 13-15 K idle largest
 * (SIP up) bottoms at 1.6-3 K: the instant breaker tier, the PHY-abort altitude.
 * So nearly every browser VISIT (page + favicon + probe) tripped the breaker and
 * the next visitor got "site cannot be loaded". No tuning fixes a per-request
 * cost that starts below the danger line. The raw state machine serves a request
 * for ~zero heap, so the PAGE now comes from it too: it listens on :80 (browser
 * habit) and :8081 (existing tools), one client at a time, keep-alive. The
 * WebServer still exists for what genuinely needs it — multipart /upload from
