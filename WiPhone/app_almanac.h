/*
 * app_almanac.h - Menu > Almanac: sun, moon, solunar, position and date, offline
 * (docs/almanac.md, "On the phone"; README "Almanac").
 *
 * Seven screens, all MenuWidget lists built from almanac_lines.cpp - the same lines the serial
 * `almanac` prints: TODAY (the first), SUN, MOON, SOLUNAR, POSITION, DATE, SETTINGS.
 * Keys: Up/Down scroll; Left/Right step the day (-365..+365) on TODAY/SUN/MOON/SOLUNAR; OK
 * opens an entry or toggles a setting (and on SUN/MOON/SOLUNAR the left soft key goes back to
 * today); Back goes up, then exits.
 *
 * ── WHAT COSTS WHAT, AND WHERE IT RUNS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The astronomy is software double on the ESP32 (~26.5 us a libm call with its arithmetic at
 * 160 MHz, the clock whenever WiFi is on - the app cannot raise it). MEASURED on phone 2,
 * 2026-09-27, before this design: the core day (sun 1,843 + moon 3,668 + solunar 91 libm calls)
 * took 148,485 us in ONE pass, the TODAY build on top of it 26 ms more (all of it
 * astroMoonPhaseAt, 956 calls, 740 of them the search for the last new moon - for an age TODAY
 * does not show): `almanac cost` said 174 ms, and one pass logged a 334 ms LOOP STALL.
 *   - The day's tables are computed IN SLICES on the app timer (almanac_lines.h, almDayWorkRun):
 *     a slice works until ALM_SLICE_US (25 ms) has gone, a unit at a time (a node or a 5-minute
 *     sample of a sun or moon day, <= ~5 ms; a quarter's or a new moon's search ~20 ms, only
 *     ever as a slice's FIRST unit), then gives the loop back for ALM_SLICE_GAP_MS - counted
 *     from the slice's END (review 2026-09-27: WiPhone.ino re-arms the app timer from the pass's
 *     START, so a 30 ms slice with a 15 ms period ran again on the very next pass; the period is
 *     now the slice's own length + the gap). Estimated worst slice ~25 + 5 ms.
 *     ONE THING A PASS: a slice that lands a part does not rebuild or repaint - the NEXT timer
 *     pass does that and runs no slice (~6-12 ms of rows + the menu drawn + the band pushed,
 *     ~48 ms estimated: drewInsideBand, the full-screen push is ~60). Before, a landing pass was
 *     slice + rebuild + full push, ~100-120 ms estimated, 3-5 times a day computed.
 *     The core is ~6 slices, ~0.4 s from a key press to whole; the screen shows each part's rows
 *     as it lands, "Computing..." until then.
 *   - Kept per (shown day, the day's offset, the place WHERE IT WAS KEYED to within almSamePlace's
 *     0.001 deg ~ 100 m - a tolerance, not a grid: GPS noise across a grid line re-keyed the day)
 *     in two slots, TODAY's and the stepped day's, so stepping away and back does not recompute.
 *   - Key handlers compute NO table and do no search or scan: Left/Right and OK only (re)key a
 *     slot and build from what is there; onto a day not computed yet, no astronomy at all.
 *   - The minute tick (TIME_UPDATE_EVENT) rebuilds the open screen from the caches: the
 *     countdown, "Sun now" (~27 libm calls), "Moon now" (~215), the moon's phase at now without a
 *     search (~215; MOON's age from the cached new moons, AlmMoonAge). Estimated <= ~12 ms.
 *   - POSITION is the only screen with a 1 Hz timer; it reads the elevation card (elevSampleCard)
 *     ON THAT TIMER only, never in a key handler, and only when the place has moved ~10 m.
 *   - A rebuild keeps the list where it was scrolled (almMenuTop) and the highlight on the row
 *     with the same words, else the same position.
 * Every slice, every build, every paint and each part of the day is timed with micros() into
 * gAlmanacCost: `almanac cost` prints them; `almanac bench` times each piece now, in one pass.
