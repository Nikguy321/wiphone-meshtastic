 * retransmits while `self._mesh_sends < 2` at books.py, with booksync.py's
 * MESH_REPEAT_S = 7.0, and a resend reuses the same nonce and turnedAt. The dedup loop below
 * only ever scans what is CURRENTLY parked, so once the reader has acted on a packet and it
 * has been removed, the second copy is "new" again and parks itself.
 *
 * ⛔ The visible result is the nag the decline branch exists to prevent: press "stay where I
 * am", and about seven seconds later the identical card is back. Accepting has the same
 * shape — you jump, and the place you just jumped to is offered again.
 *
 * A few hashes of recently retired packets is enough to close it. ⚠ Not cleared by Init():
 * a decline must survive leaving and re-entering Books, which is well inside the 7 s window.
 * ⚠ A 32-bit hash can in principle collide and silently drop one real offer; with eight
 * entries that is remote, and the cost is one missed card against a guaranteed repeat nag.
 * Pressing Sync again always produces a fresh nonce, so a deliberate resend is never a
 * tombstone hit. */
