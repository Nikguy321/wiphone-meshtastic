/*
 * app_gbc_xfer.h — the phone's file-transfer web server (core).
 *
 * Turns the phone into a little upload server so you can put files on the SD card from a
 * computer without typing on the phone. Open http://wiphone.local (or the shown IP) in a
 * browser and drag-and-drop, or paste a direct download URL. Falls back to a WiFi hotspot
 * when the phone isn't joined to a network.
 *
 * ONE server, PARAMETERISED — not one per app. It began as the Game Boy ROM uploader and is
 * now also the book uploader. Copying it was the obvious move and the wrong one: the two
 * things that make it survive on hardware (feeding the task watchdog inside a long POST, and
 * one file per request) are exactly the kind of lesson that rots in a copy. There is also
 * only one port 80, so a second server object would be a bug waiting for someone to open
 * both screens.
 *
 * Each app supplies an XferConfig and owns its own screen; this module owns only the server.
