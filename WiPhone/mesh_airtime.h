/*
 * mesh_airtime.h — how long a LoRa frame is on the air, and how much text fits in one.
 *
 * Two pieces of arithmetic that used to live as guesses in comments and constants:
 *
 *   1. AIRTIME. MeshPhy::send() polls TxDone with a timeout, and until 2026-09-19 that
 *      timeout was a flat 2000 ms. A maximum-length frame at the registers this phone writes
 *      (SF11, BW 250 kHz, CR 4/5, explicit header, CRC on, LDRO off, 16-symbol preamble) is
 *      2157 ms on the air — so a long channel text was declared "TX timeout", its IRQ flags
 *      cleared and the chip forced back to RX WHILE THE PA WAS STILL KEYED. Truncated on
 *      air, send() false, and the whole stall paid anyway. Filed as a latent P2 in
 *      docs/HANDOFF.md; the fix is that the wait follows the frame.
 *
 *   2. THE TEXT BUDGET. The Data protobuf around a text costs bytes, the 16-byte header
 *      costs bytes, a PKI DM's CCM tag and nonce cost 12 more, and the LoRa frame is 255.
 *      MESH_TEXT_LEN (234) is the RECEIVE buffer and was also the compose cap, so the
 *      widget let a person type a message the radio could never send. The largest text a
 *      plain channel frame holds is 232, a PKI DM 220 — and the Meshtastic phone apps stop
 *      the user at 200 UTF-8 bytes (Android MESSAGE_CHARACTER_LIMIT_BYTES, iOS
 *      TextMessageField.maxbytes), so that is what "everybody else" can send back.
 *
 * 🔑 ARDUINO-FREE ON PURPOSE. tests/test_airtime.cpp compiles this on the Mac and asserts
 * the airtimes against numbers worked by hand from Semtech AN1200.13, and the budgets
 * against frames actually built by meshBuildData(). mesh_phy.cpp cannot be built on a host
 * (RadioHead, Hardware.h), which is why the formula does not live there.
