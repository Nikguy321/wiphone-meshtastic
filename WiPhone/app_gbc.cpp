/*
 * app_gbc.cpp — WiPhone Game Boy Color emulator (Phase 6: dual-core overlap, diagnostic)
 *
 * Two tasks + two framebuffers overlap emulation with the screen push:
 *   - emuThread (core 1): poll keypad, emulate+render into the back buffer, hand
 *     it to the blit task, switch buffers. Never touches the LCD or SD.
 *   - blitTask: owns ALL LCD and SD. Pushes finished frames while the emulator
 *     renders the next; when paused, runs the menu + save/load here too so the two
 *     cores never hit the shared SPI bus at the same time.
 *
 * Both tasks are left unpinned (pinning to core 1 starved them) and the core
 * watchdogs are disabled while playing (the two tasks saturate both cores). The
 * emulator paces to 60fps and only renders frames the blit can show, so game
 * speed and input stay correct (and authentic) even when the display can't keep up.
