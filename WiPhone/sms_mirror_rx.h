 * sms_mirror_rx.h — taking a mirrored text from COVEY and putting it in the message store.
 *
 * One entry point, deliberately, because BOTH transports end here: a CSM1 line off the radio
 * and a CSM1 line out of an HTTP response are the same record and must be folded in the same
 * way. See sms_mirror.h for why COVEY relays at all (the phone has no working TLS and cannot
 * reach the VoIP.ms API), and Storage.h's ingestMirrored() for how a duplicate is recognised.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS NOT A CHAT MESSAGE and must never be shown as one. On the mesh side it is
 * intercepted by prefix in meshtastic_service.cpp, in the same place and for the same reason
 * book-sync traffic is: a person did not send it to you, so it must not chime, vibrate, raise
 * an unread badge for the mesh app, or appear in the Chats list. What it does raise is the
 * SIP message state, because the text itself IS something to read.

 * the radio, is exactly as much news as one arriving over SIP.

 * so an open Messages screen rebuilds). The flags exist because the two transports used to
 * disagree: the LoRa path notified from inside meshService.loop() and the LAN path notified
 * NOWHERE — an arriving text stored silently, and because ingest dedups by id, a LAN-first
 * delivery permanently suppressed the LoRa copy's buzz too. Latching at the single ingest
 * point makes silence structurally impossible for any transport that ever calls it.
 *

 * least one of those was a text somebody sent YOU (the only kind worth a buzz). Both reset
