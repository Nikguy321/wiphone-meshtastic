/* notify_timing.h — how long a notification's one-shot sound is allowed to run.
 *
 * Header-only on purpose, like gnuboy/gb_romsize.h: WiPhone.ino cannot be compiled on the
 * Mac, so the arithmetic the phone ships is the arithmetic tests/test_notify.cpp checks.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ARITHMETIC AND NOT A CONSTANT. The stop timer used to be a literal 280 ms next
 * to a comment saying the player "loops, so we stop it by timer after it has played through
 * once". pop_pcm is 5,120 bytes of 8 kHz 16-bit mono — 320 ms — so 280 never let it play
 * through. It was safe only because the sound is 720 samples (90 ms) of pop followed by
 * 230 ms of zeros (measured from the array, and pinned by the test), and cutting 40 ms of
 * silence is inaudible. Nobody knew that; a longer sample would have been cut mid-sound.
 *
 * THE TWO SOURCES NEED OPPOSITE MARGINS:
 *   - the SPIFFS file player wraps to byte 0 when the file runs out, and it pushes AHEAD of
 *     the DMA (4 x 1024 samples = 512 ms deep at 8 kHz), so by the time the first samples
 *     are audible the second iteration's attack — the loudest 40 ms of the sound — is already
 *     queued behind the tail. A stop that lands PAST the end replays it. Stop EARLY.
 *   - the memory source (Audio::playPcm) plays the array once and pads with silence, so a
 *     stop that lands late costs nothing and a stop that lands early cuts the tail. Stop LATE.
 * The margin is the same 40 ms either way; only its sign differs. */

/* ── 🛑 THE RING'S LEAD: A FRESH RING PLAYS ITSELF ONCE BEFORE ANYTHING WRITTEN IS HEARD ──────
 * (integration review 3, A1.) Everything above times the SOUND; this times the DMA ring in front
 * of it. IDF 3.3's i2s_create_dma_queue() builds the TX free-buffer queue EMPTY (checked in the
 * libdriver.a this build links: it calls xQueueGenericCreate and nothing else), and neither
 * i2s_set_clk() nor i2s_start() fills it. So on a ring that is freshly installed, or installed and
 * then started, i2s_write() with timeout 0 takes NOTHING until the first buffer has played out
 * and its end-of-buffer interrupt hands it back: buffer 0 plays zeros, comes back after one
 * buffer's time, gets the first samples, and those reach the DAC one whole trip after the start.
 * music_feed.h and test_musicfeed's DmaModel say the same ("a freshly installed ring plays itself
 * (zeros) once before anything written reaches the DAC").
 *
 * The pop's ring is 4 x 1024 mono at 8 kHz = 512 ms a trip, and playPop() installs it FRESH on
 * nearly every pop (the boot ring is 16 kHz stereo; music's and a game's are other rings; and the
 * last pop's restore() put one of those back). The chirp (the first 90 ms of pop_pcm) was due at
 * the DAC at ~512 ms - and the teardown at 360 ms zeroed every buffer (ceasePlayback) and
 * reinstalled the ring (restore()), 150 ms before it could sound. It survived only when a loop
 * stall pushed the teardown past ~512 ms: the 0.9.65 report "sometimes sound will play, but
 * sometimes it won't". 0.9.66's exact stop timer and 0.9.79's non-blocking LoRa send took most of
 * those stalls away, and the master mute hid the rest. (Before 0.9.66 the SPIFFS open, 1.2-1.6 s,
 * sat between the start and the first write, so the queue was full and the chirp played at once.)
 *
 * THE QUEUE IS ONE SHORT OF THE RING. i2s_create_dma_queue() creates it dma_buf_count - 1 deep
 * (objdump of this build's libdriver.a: `addi.n a10, a3, -1` is xQueueGenericCreate's length), and
 * at each buffer's end the ISR, finding it full, first takes the OLDEST entry off - the buffer the
 * DMA is starting to play, stale by a trip - and zeroes it (installI2S() sets tx_desc_auto_clear).
 * So a full queue holds every buffer EXCEPT the one playing, oldest = the next to play.
 *
 * HOW THE POP FOUND THE RING (Audio::playPop() reports it; the log line names it):
 *   FRESH     - installed for this pop (or its rate changed, which forces a reinstall): the queue
 *               is empty and the DMA at buffer 0, so the lead is one trip - less the few ms from
 *               turnOn()'s i2s_start() to the caller's stamp, which only lengthen the padding.
 *   RESTARTED - the device was off and the ring it left is reused: start()'s i2s_start() puts the
 *               DMA back at buffer 0 under the queue as the last session left it, so the first
 *               buffer written is somewhere up to three buffers ahead of the DMA - a lead anywhere
 *               in [0, one trip).
 *   RUNNING   - the device was on and the ring kept (the 8 kHz ring a call or the ring left, and a
 *               pop's restore() did not replace). Once it has idled three buffers (384 ms) since its
 *               last write, the ISR has filled the queue and the first write lands in the NEXT
 *               buffer, never the one playing: a lead under one buffer (128 ms). But a pop that
 *               starts sooner - a burst, arriving just after the last pop's teardown - finds the
 *               queue still (nearly) empty, drained by that pop's padding: a lead up to a trip. The
 *               plain 360 ms stop lost the whole chirp from 0-20 ms after the teardown and part of
 *               it to ~150 ms (test_notify models it). So a lead anywhere in [0, one trip).
 * Every state is a range bounded by one trip, and the source's own margin rule resolves it: the
 * play-once memory source must stop LATE, so it takes the WHOLE TRIP IN EVERY STATE (only zero
 * padding is lengthened, and the early finishes - the ring, a call, a track, a game - still cut
 * it). 0.9.79's first cut took 0 for RUNNING on the premise that its queue is always full.
 *
 * 🛑 THE LOOPING FILE TAKES NO LEAD, IN ANY STATE. Its SPIFFS open (0.5-1.6 s measured) runs AFTER
 * turnOn() has started the DMA and BEFORE the caller's stamp, so by the stamp the ring has played
 * its first trip and the queue is full: the first write lands in the next buffer, a lead under
 * 128 ms. 0.9.79's first cut gave it the FRESH trip too ("exact, so both take it"): a stop at
 * 792 ms, long after the wrap (320-448 ms), which let the SECOND attack play - the replay this
 * file's early-stop rule exists to prevent (test_notify models it). Taking the least lead keeps the
 * rule whatever the open cost: at 280 ms the chirp (heard by ~218 ms) is whole and the wrap never
 * sounds. An open faster than three buffers (384 ms - never measured on these phones) leaves more
 * lead and the chirp may be cut, as the early rule always allowed. Unreachable in the shipping
 * build: the only caller passes pop_pcm, and playPcm() cannot fail after turnOn().
 *
 * ⚠ ALL OF THIS ASSUMES THE LAST WRITER LEFT IDF's `curr_ptr` FULL, as the pop's own padding does
 * in practice (a 2,400-sample chunk is nearly always waiting, so the queue refuses first). A
 * half-filled one - the RTP stream writes a packet at a time, and music_feed.h's closeRing() is
 * the only writer that tops its buffer up - is written FIRST on RESTARTED and RUNNING, wherever
 * the DMA is: the out-of-order case test_musicfeed pins for music. Not modelled here; the first
 * pop after a call is where it would show. */
