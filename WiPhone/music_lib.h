/*
 * music_lib.h — the track list and what plays next.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Arduino and SD headers so the whole of it compiles on a Mac under
 * ASan and is exercised by tests/test_music.cpp. That is the same split that made
 * book_layout testable: the app owns the screen and the file handles, this owns the
 * decisions. Everything here is plain C++ over caller-supplied strings.
 *
 * ── WHAT "NEXT" MEANS, BECAUSE IT IS NOT OBVIOUS ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two orders in play and confusing them is the classic shuffle bug:
 *
 *   - the LIBRARY order, which is what the list on screen shows (sorted by name), and
 *   - the PLAY order, which is the library order or a shuffled permutation of it.
 *
 * `MusicQueue` stores a permutation `order[]` of track indices plus a cursor into it. Next
 * and previous move the CURSOR, never the library. So the on-screen list never reorders
 * under the user's finger when they toggle shuffle mid-song, and "previous" in shuffle
 * goes back to the track that actually played rather than to a fresh random one.
 *
 * ⚠ Toggling shuffle KEEPS THE CURRENT TRACK PLAYING and reshuffles the rest around it.
 * Rebuilding the permutation from scratch would jump to whatever landed in slot 0, which
 * reads as "shuffle skipped my song".
