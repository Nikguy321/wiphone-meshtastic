/*
 * almanac_lines.h - what the Almanac SAYS, line by line, for every screen: TODAY, SUN, MOON,
 * SOLUNAR, POSITION, DATE and SETTINGS (docs/almanac.md, "On the phone").
 *
 * The phone's Almanac (app_almanac.cpp) turns each line into a menu row; the serial `almanac`
 * command prints the SAME lines, one say() each. So the bench proof against PyEphem is a proof
 * of the screen, not of a second formatter that happens to agree with it.
 *
 * Two halves:
 *   - AlmDay: the day's heavy tables (astroSunDay / astroMoonDay / astroSolunar, and on demand
 *     the day before and after and the next four quarters). ~5,600 libm calls for the core,
 *     ~11,000 with everything: software double on the ESP32, 148 ms for the core on phone 2 at
 *     160 MHz. The app computes them ONCE per (day, place, offset), IN SLICES on its timer
 *     (almDayWorkRun below: no pass over ~30 ms of it), and keeps them.
 *   - the line builders: cheap. They read an AlmDay and a context (now, the UTC offset, the
 *     place, the settings) and emit rows; a part not computed yet is a "Computing..." row. The
 *     only astronomy they do themselves is "now" - the sun's position (~27 libm calls, ~0.7 ms on
 *     the phone), the moon's (~215, ~6 ms), the moon's phase at one instant without a search
 *     (astroMoonPhaseWith, ~215) - and POSITION's declination (~180) and grid (~60). No builder
 *     searches or scans when the context says so (AlmCtx.noSearch: the app's), which is what
 *     keeps the minute tick and a key press cheap.
 *
 * Rounding, which is a LEGAL question here, not a cosmetic one: sun and moon times are rounded
 * to the NEAREST minute (the almanac convention). Legal light is rounded INWARD - first legal
 * light UP, last legal light DOWN, and the countdowns likewise ("in" rounds up, "left" rounds
 * down) - so the window this phone shows is never wider than the true one. On a day the true
 * first light is 06:33:20 the screen says 06:34, not 06:33.
 *
 * Pure: no Arduino/ESP-IDF headers, no heap, no static mutable state; stack frames stay small
 * (a few 48-byte line buffers). tests/test_almanac_lines.cpp proves the wordings and measures
 * every row against the phone's own font (AKROBAT_BOLD_20, 232 px) - and every wrapped sentence
 * (ALM_ROW_WRAP: a waypoint's name, the DST notes) broken as the app breaks it, whole, at 220 px.

 * read 17:10 at that moment: the planned end of legal light an hour LATE. So the shown day's
 * times are given in the offset it WILL have (or had): today's -1 h across the autumn change,
 * +1 h across the spring one - when usDst, today's offset is one a changing US zone has on today's
 * side of the change (daylight -4..-9, standard -5..-10), and the shown day lies on the other
 * side of the change between them. Both changes crossed (a day ~a year away) is the same side.
 * The phone's clock is never touched.
 * TODAY'S SIDE follows almDstReminder's 2 AM rule (review 2026-09-27, again): on the change day
 * before 2 AM the phone is still on the old side (the reminder says "set Time offset then"), so
 * Nov 2 seen at 01:00 on Nov 1 is in -8 and says so; from 2 AM it is taken to be on the new side
 * already (the reminder, and the day screens, say to check). A SHOWN day is on the side its date
 * is: the change day itself on the new one (all but its first two hours are).
 * Returns the offset (s); *changeDay (may be NULL) = the local day number (days since 1970) of the
 * change crossed, 0 = none. */
