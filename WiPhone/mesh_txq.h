/*
 * mesh_txq.h — what the LoRa radio sends next, and when. Pure, no Arduino, host-tested by
 * tests/test_txq.cpp.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS A QUEUE AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🛑 THE 0.6-1.5 s 'mesh' LOOP STALLS WERE LORA TRANSMITS, NOT THE DATABASE SAVE. Until this
 * change MeshPhy::send() put the SX1276 into TX and then busy-waited on TxDone for the frame's
 * whole time on air, on the superloop task — so every relay, ACK, beacon and text froze the
 * keypad, the screen and the WiFi stack for 0.5-2.2 s. The stall values in /health.log sit on
 * the airtime lattice to within a few ms: 166 ms of preamble + (8 + 5k) x 8.192 ms, i.e. steps
 * of 40.96 ms (518, 559, 600, 641 ... 1501 ... 2157), plus the bit-banged FIFO write — +2..+4 ms
 * at 240 MHz, +9..+12 ms at 80 MHz. Phone 1's 2026-09-03 log: 278 of 346 STALL records on the
 * lattice, all at scr=0 (nobody touching it); ~50 more are the ~307 ms WiFi scan, not the mesh.
 * The flood relay alone fires ~20 times an hour (it relays everything with hops left, including
 * LongFast traffic it cannot decrypt), which is why it looked like "the phone stalls when idle".
 * The SD database save it was blamed on is ~50-130 ms since 0.9.19 (the `bench` numbers in
 * meshtastic_service.cpp); the "~1.5 s" was the SPIFFS-era figure.
 *
 * Now the chip is started and LEFT to transmit (MeshPhy::startSend), the loop checks TxDone on
 * each pass (MeshPhy::serviceTx), and everything that wants the air waits its turn here:
 *
 *   OWN queue   frames this phone originated, FIFO — texts, beacons, NodeInfo, neighbour and
 *               replay packets — with our routing ACKs put AHEAD of them (the sender is
 *               waiting on the ACK and retries without it) but never ahead of each other and
 *               never ahead of a frame already on the air.
 *   RELAY slots somebody else's packet, flood-relayed after a random 130-700 ms. Only when the
 *               own queue is empty, earliest-due first, and CANCELLED if the same packet is
 *               heard relayed by somebody else first (stock FloodingRouter does exactly this
 *               for a non-router role).
 *
 * 🔑 ONE START PER PASS. meshTxPick() never picks while the PHY is busy, and the pump calls it
 * once a pass — so "two transmits in one pass" (the 1,985 ms maximum: 1009.7 + 968.7 ms + two
 * FIFO writes) cannot happen by construction, where before it was a rule only the position
 * beacon obeyed.
 *
 * ⚠ STORAGE IS THE CALLER'S. The service hands meshTxqInit() PSRAM (8 frames, ~2 KB); a phone
 * whose PSRAM allocation failed gets a 2-frame internal fallback instead of no radio. Nothing
 * here allocates.
