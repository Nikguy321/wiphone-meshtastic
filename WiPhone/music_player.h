/*
 * music_player.h — the part of the music player that outlives its screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT INSIDE app_music ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Apps here are created when you open them and DELETED when you leave. If the library,
 * the queue and the current track lived in MusicApp, backing out of the screen would
 * stop the music and forget where you were — which is not what a music player does. So
 * the state lives here, in one place with static lifetime, and MusicApp is a view onto
 * it that can come and go.
 *
 * musicPlayerLoop() is pumped from the main loop next to meshService.loop(), which is
 * what makes a track advance to the next one while you are reading a book or looking at
 * the map. Audio::loop() is already pumped from the same place and does the decoding;
 * this only decides what plays next.
 *
 * ⚠ Music and a phone call cannot both have the I2S peripheral. The rule is that a call
 * wins: musicPlayerPause() is called when one arrives, and nothing here resumes on its
 * own afterwards, because a phone that starts playing music at you when you hang up is
 * worse than one you have to press play on.

 * Kept in RAM ONLY and deliberately not written to the configs file. It survives
 * stopping and starting playback, and resets to the default on a restart — which is what
 * you want on a phone whose volume you can nudge with a side button by accident.
 *
 * ⚠ It is a SEPARATE level from the call volume. The codec has one set of registers, so
 * playing music overwrites what calls use; the player captures the call levels the first
 * time it takes over and puts them back when music stops. Without that, one quiet album

 * Pause the track if one is SOUNDING (the place is kept, as a pause always keeps it), and
 * give the call levels and route back even if something ELSE already stopped the track.
 *
 * 🛑 THAT SECOND HALF IS THE FIX. The ringtone's playRingtone() -> ceasePlayback() takes
 * `playback` away from music before anything asks musicPlayerIsPlaying(), and so does a
 * notification pop — so musicPlayerPause() saw "not playing", skipped restoreCallVolume(), and
 * the phone rang, and the answered call ran, at the MUSIC level (default -18 dB, as low as
 * -45). Idempotent: with nothing playing and nothing stashed it does nothing, so the main loop

 * live in the player's stash, put back when music lets go. So "what are the call volumes" is
 * answered by the stash while one is held, and a new call level must go INTO the stash:
 * writing it to the codec lands under the music (headphones jumped about 24 dB), and the
 * stale stash then overwrote it when the music stopped, so a Settings > Audio save did not
 * take until a reboot. Settings > Audio is the caller.
 *
 * musicPlayerCallVolumes: true + the stashed levels while music holds the codec; false means
 * the codec itself holds the call levels (ask audio->getVolumes()).
 * musicPlayerSetCallVolumes: true = stored in the stash, applied when music lets go; false =
 * no stash is held, the caller writes the codec itself. Not clamped here: restoring goes
 * through Audio::setVolumes(), which clamps. */
