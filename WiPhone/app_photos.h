/*
 * app_photos.h — a photo viewer for the SD card, and the one place wallpaper is chosen.
 *
 * Three screens:
 *   LIST     everything in /photos this phone can actually decode, newest name order, with
 *            size and a lock marker. Non-decodable files are NOT listed — a viewer that
 *            offers you a file and then shows a grey rectangle is worse than one that does
 *            not offer it.
 *   VIEW     one photo, scaled to fit, LEFT/RIGHT to walk the folder (wrapping).
 *   OPTIONS  OK on a photo: wallpaper / rename / lock / delete.
 *
 * ── FORMATS, AND WHY THIS LIST AND NOT A LONGER ONE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *   .jpg .jpeg   baseline colour, via the ESP32's ROM TJpgDec (what drawImage already uses)
 *                ...and baseline GREYSCALE, via jpeg_grey.cpp, which exists because the ROM
 *                decoder flatly refuses greyscale — the e-reader hit that first.
 *   .bmp         24- and 32-bit uncompressed, decoded here. Cheap to support and it is what
 *                screenshots and simple exports tend to be.
 *
 * ⚠ **PNG IS DELIBERATELY NOT SUPPORTED**, and it is the one people will ask about. There is
 * no PNG decoder in this firmware or in the ESP32 ROM; adding one means vendoring a library
 * plus a line buffer's worth of RAM on a phone that fights for every contiguous kilobyte, and
 * it would buy no colour a JPEG cannot already show. If it is ever added, `photoDraw()` is
 * the single function that needs to learn about it.
 *
 * ── THE DEFAULT WALLPAPER CANNOT BE LOST, BY CONSTRUCTION ────────────────────────────────
 * It is not a file. GUI's loader tries /background.jpg on the SD card, then the same path in
 * SPIFFS, and falls back to `image_i256` — an array COMPILED INTO THE FIRMWARE. So "restore
 * the default" is not a copy operation that could fail: it deletes the override and lets the
 * fallback surface. Nothing the user can reach can destroy it.
 *
 * ── 🛑 AND THAT FALLBACK IS WHY THIS FEATURE SHIPPED BROKEN (fixed 2026-08-25) ────────────
 * The sentence above was true of the CODE and false of the PHONE. GUI::init() ran the loader
 * ~50 lines BEFORE setup() called SD.begin(), so "tries the SD card" asked an unmounted
 * filesystem and always got false. Every wallpaper this app wrote was dropped, on every
 * boot, and because a rejected override lands in the SAME fallback as "none chosen", the
 * screen and the log said nothing at all. Nick: "I tried to apply a background from a photo
 * but nothing changed."
 *
 * Three things came out of it, and each is worth keeping:
 *   1. GUI::loadWallpaper() is called AGAIN after SD.begin(), and that is the call that works.
 *   2. setAsWallpaper() no longer trusts its own copy — it asks the loader and repeats the
 *      answer. A greyscale JPEG still views here and still cannot be a wallpaper (TJpgDec
 *      refuses greyscale; jpeg_grey.cpp is what makes the VIEWER work), and now it says so.
 *   3. `wallpaper` on the serial console prints what the loader found. A silent fallback is
 *      what kept this invisible; it is not silent any more.
