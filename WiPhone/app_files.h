/*
 * app_files.h — a general, lightweight SD file browser + viewer + uploader.
 *
 * Three screens in one app, deliberately minimal:
 *   BROWSE  folders and files, dirs first, bounded listing (no unbounded heap on a phone
 *           that fights for every contiguous kilobyte).
 *   VIEW    text-ish files, paged with the SAME layout engine and advance-corrected
 *           measure the e-reader uses — so wrapping is correct by construction. A file the
 *           viewer will not render (binary, or huge) still opens: it gets an info page
 *           (name, size, why) instead of a garbage dump.
 *   XFER    the one parameterised upload server (app_gbc_xfer), pointed at the folder you
 *           are standing in. This is the piece that makes the browser more than a toy:
 *           until now /roms and /books were the only folders reachable over WiFi at all.
 *
 * Files delete behind a confirm; FOLDERS can be copied, moved and deleted too (0.9.72): the
 * `[ This folder... ]` row at the top of any folder but the root opens Copy / Move / Delete
 * for the folder you are standing in — that is how a folder is "selected" (Nick, 2026-09-20:
 * "there is no way to select a folder and copy/paste/delete... found it out when trying to
 * delete 'home' in the maps folder"). A tree operation is a JOB: it runs a slice at a time on
 * the app timer with a progress screen, never blocking the phone for the minute a thousand
 * tiles take, and Back stops it where it is (what is done stays done, and the screen says
 * so). A folder move is one rename. The path questions that keep it safe are in
 * files_paths.h, host-tested.
