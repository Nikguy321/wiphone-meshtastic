/*
 * book_hash.h — SHA-256, SHA-1, HMAC-SHA256 and base32, for booksync and the EPUB reader.
 *
 * Why not mbedtls, which is already linked in for mesh_crypto's AES?
 *
 * Because these bytes have to match COVEY's Python EXACTLY or a sync packet is dropped in
 * silence — a wrong implementation and a wrong passcode are indistinguishable on the wire,
 * by design (see booksync.h). The only way to prove a match is to run the shipping code
 * against vectors generated from COVEY's own booksync.py, and that test has to build on a
 * Mac. Self-contained code means the native test exercises the identical bytes that run on
 * the phone; an mbedtls backend would mean testing one implementation and shipping another.
 *
 * Cost is about 2 KB of flash. There is no Arduino dependency here on purpose.
