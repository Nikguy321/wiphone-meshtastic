/*
 * weather.h - the pure half of the Almanac's weather (0.9.81): everything that can be decided
 * without a network, a card or a screen, so the host suite (tests/test_weather.cpp) can prove it.
 * The device half - the gates, the worker's two GETs, the card - is weather_net.cpp; the rows are
 * weather_lines.cpp; the screen is the Almanac's WEATHER (app_almanac.cpp).
 *
 * ⚠ Deliberately free of every Arduino and ESP-IDF header. Keep it that way.
 *
 * THE SOURCES (decided 2026-10-03 with Nick: "Yes and yes!"):
 *   - Open-Meteo's forecast, no key, free for non-commercial use, CC BY 4.0 - the screen credits
 *     "Weather: Open-Meteo.com". One GET, fetched in SI (m/s, C, hPa, mm) and formatted at draw
 *     time in the Units setting, with timeformat=unixtime (every time a UTC epoch) and
 *     timezone=auto (utc_offset_seconds: only ever a WARNING when it differs from the phone's
 *     offset - no clock is ever set from a response). Never sunrise/sunset (the Almanac owns
 *     them), never gzip (the phone's HTTPClient asks for identity; measured: 2.9 KB chunked).
 *   - The NWS's active alerts for the point (US only, public domain). One GET, &status=actual
 *     (a "Test" message is never a warning), a descriptive User-Agent with the project's URL and
 *     no e-mail (no User-Agent = a 403 HTML page from Akamai).
 *
 * MEASURED FROM THE MAC (2026-10-03, public points only - Seattle 47.61,-122.33 and offshore
 * 45,-130; the fixtures in tests/fixtures/wx/ are those, with the echoed point scrubbed):
 *   - Open-Meteo: 200, Transfer-Encoding: chunked, ~2.9 KB for current + 48 hours + 7 days.
 *     `current.time` is the start of a 15-MINUTE MODEL SLOT, never the fetch time; daily.time is
 *     the LOCATION's local midnight as a UTC epoch. Errors are 400 {"error":true,"reason":"..."}.
 *     null may appear in ANY array (a model with no value) - every reader here takes it.
 *   - NWS: an empty answer is ~230 B with Content-Length; one alert ~8.9 KB and two 14.7 KB as
 *     served (pretty-printed); a storm day is unbounded. A point outside the NWS domain (Canada,
 *     the UK) is a 400 whose detail says "out of bounds"; offshore US marine zones answer 200
 *     with NO features - so "200, empty" is "No alerts at 07:10", never "safe on land". Times
 *     carry the issuing office's offset ("2026-10-03T16:18:00-05:00"). `expires` is the MESSAGE's
 *     expiry (it can fall before onset); `ends` is the event's and may be null (Special Weather
 *     Statements): an alert is shown until `ends`, else `expires`. 6 of 415 had urgency "Past".
 *
 * THE FOUR ALERT ANSWERS, never a bare "No alerts": "No alerts at 07:10" (an empty 200);
 * "Alerts: US only (NWS)" (the 400 out of bounds - any OTHER 400 is a failure); "Alerts not
 * checked" (5xx, a timeout, TLS, an HTML page) keeping the previous alerts with their own as-of;
 * and "Alerts: 9+ (too many to list)" when the body outgrew the phone's 64 KB buffer - an empty
 * answer is ~230 B, so a body that big PROVES alerts exist, and the count comes from a streaming
 * counter that saw every byte (wxCountFeed), not from the buffer.
