/*
 * tile_png.h — the smallest PNG decoder that covers map tiles, on top of the inflater the
 * firmware already has.
 *
 * ── WHY IN-REPO AND NOT A LIBRARY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The sources are known: OpenTopoMap serves 256x256 8-bit PALETTE PNGs (measured
 * 2026-09-18), and USGS's "MIXED" services can hand back an RGBA PNG at a coverage edge.
 * That is: a chunk walk, one zlib stream, five row filters, and a colour-type switch —
 * about three hundred lines whose behaviour can be pinned on the host against Pillow.
 * PNGdec / pngle / lodepng each bring a second inflater, an allocator to redirect into PSRAM
 * and a licence; the EPUB parser already proved the ROM `tinfl` here (epub_parse.cpp:99-113,
 * raw deflate into a whole PSRAM output buffer, ~11 KB of state).
 *
 * ── WHAT IS SUPPORTED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   colour types 0 (grey), 2 (RGB), 3 (palette), 4 (grey+alpha), 6 (RGBA); bit depth 8 for
 *   all, plus 1/2/4 for palette and grey; non-interlaced; exactly 256x256. A tRNS chunk on a
 *   palette image is honoured the same way alpha is: a pixel more transparent than half
 *   becomes `nodata` (the caller's "no tile here" colour), so a source's transparent edges
 *   look like the edge of the map rather than like black ground.
 * ── WHAT IS REFUSED, WITH A REASON ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   16-bit samples, interlacing, any other size, a zlib stream with a preset dictionary, a
 *   truncated or over-long IDAT, a bad filter byte. Every refusal fills `why`.
 *
 * Memory is the caller's problem only for `out`; the decoder allocates its own scratch
 * (the concatenated IDAT, the inflated rows, the inflater state) through tilePngAlloc —
 * PSRAM on the device, malloc on the host — and frees it before returning.
