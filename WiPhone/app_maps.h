/*
 * app_maps.h — an offline map. Tiles off the SD card, pins you drop yourself, and everything
 * the mesh already knows about where people are, on one screen.
 *
 * Main menu -> Maps (its own row, with an icon).
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IT IS FOR
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The Meshtastic screens already carry every fact this app draws: camp is a waypoint, the
 * truck is a waypoint, everyone's last position arrives on port 3 every few minutes, and the
 * Nodes list turns them into "3.2km E of camp - 4 min ago". That sentence is correct and it
 * is the wrong shape for the question people actually ask, which is "is he on the other side
 * of the creek or this side". A map answers that and a list cannot.
 *
 * So: no new radio traffic, no new database, no new source of truth. This app is a VIEW of
 * state that already exists, plus one thing of its own — pins, which are your private marks
 * on your own map and are shared with the mesh only when you say so.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE TILES: RAW RGB565, AND WHY NOT PNG
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * /maps/<area>/<z>/<x>/<y>.565 — 256x256 pixels, RGB565, little-endian, 131072 bytes exactly.
 * Standard slippy-map z/x/y numbering, so the tiles a computer already has for COVEY's map are
 * the same tiles, converted once by tools/convert_tiles.py. docs/maps.md is the format.
 *
 * 🛑 THE PHONE DECODES NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN, NOT A SHORTCUT. There is no PNG
 * decoder in this firmware and adding one costs a vendored library plus contiguous internal
 * RAM on a phone whose crashes are internal-heap fragmentation (app_photos.h has the whole
 * argument). The ESP32's ROM JPEG decoder exists but refuses greyscale outright — jpeg_grey.h
 * exists solely because 33 of 45 pictures in one book were 1-component JPEGs. A map made of
 * compressed tiles would therefore work until the day it met a tile of the wrong flavour, in
 * the woods, with no way to tell what was wrong.
 *
 * Raw costs 8x the card space (~85 MB for a 20x20 km area at z12-z15 — nothing on a 32 GB
 * card) and buys: zero decode time, zero decoder memory, and exactly ONE failure mode, which
 * is "the file is not 131072 bytes long" and is checkable in one comparison.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THE CARD IS READ IN PIECES
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ⚠ ONE TILE IS 128 KB AND EVERYTHING IN THIS FIRMWARE SHARES ONE TASK. A 128 KB SD read is
 * 100-250 ms on this hardware, and 250 ms is precisely the threshold the superloop's own
 * stall detector was built to complain about (0.9.58) — the same 1-2 s freezes that drop WiFi
 * and eat keypresses. Four tiles for one screen, read the obvious way, is a second of frozen
 * phone every time you pan.
 *
 * So a tile arrives in MAPS_CHUNK_BYTES pieces, one piece per timer tick, and the map draws
 * the hole in the meantime as a plainly-marked grey square. The screen is honest about what
 * it does not have yet, the keypad never stops answering, and no single pass through the
 * superloop owes more than a fraction of a tile.
 *
 * The file is opened, seeked, read and CLOSED on every piece rather than held open across
 * ticks. That costs a directory lookup per piece and removes the entire class of bug where an
 * app is torn down, or the card is pulled, with a File still live.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MEMORY
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MAPS_TILE_SLOTS x 128 KB of PSRAM, allocated ONCE when the app opens and freed when it
 * closes — no churn, because heap churn is what this phone dies of. Internal RAM: a file
 * handle and some ints. The app itself is PSRAM too (WiPhoneApp::operator new).
 *
 * A 240x250 viewport over 256 px tiles touches at most 2x2 = 4 tiles, so 6 slots means
 * panning across a tile boundary does not immediately evict something about to be needed
 * again. Fewer than 2 slots and the app refuses to run and says why.
