/*
 * booksync_inbox.h — where a position from another device waits until you open the book.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY A PARKING SPOT EXISTS AT ALL
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A LoRa round trip does not fit inside the moment you press "Sync". COVEY solves this by
 * listening continuously and keeping late arrivals for later (`app._book_pending` — D-089),
 * and this is the same idea: the radio takes whatever turns up, whenever it turns up, and the
 * reader looks in here when it opens a book. Without it, "sync now, pick it up later" is not
 * possible and the feature only works if both devices are awake, in the same app, at the same
 * second.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE PACKET IS STORED RAW, AND VERIFIED LATER
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠ Deliberate: the mesh service must not need the booksync passcode. It runs in the radio
 * path and knows nothing about books, so it recognises a sync packet by its PREFIX only —
 * bookSyncIsSyncText(), checked BEFORE the mac, exactly as COVEY does. That ordering matters:
 * a packet signed with somebody else's passcode is still not a chat message, and dumping
 * "CBS1 MFRGG..." into the Chats list would be worse than dropping it.
 *
 * Verification happens in bookSyncInboxFindFor(), called by the reader, which is the only
 * part that holds the key. A packet that fails the mac is simply never matched.
 *
 * This module is plain C++ with no Arduino headers, so the matching logic — the part that can
 * silently do nothing — is exercised by the host tests.

 * price of a comparison — bookSyncInboxFindFor() verifies an HMAC per parked packet, which
 * is not something to run once a second for nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ A packet IDENTICAL to one already parked does NOT bump it. A mesh rebroadcast is the
 * same news arriving twice, and re-offering a position the reader is already looking at
 * would turn flood routing into a nag. Pressing Sync again on the sender does produce a
 * different packet (its own turnedAt and nonce), so a deliberate resend still counts. */

 * because that is the reading event being described — not by when the packet happened to
 * arrive, which says more about radio conditions than about the reader.
 *
 * Nothing is removed: the reader decides whether to take the jump, and a position it declines
 * should not evaporate. Call bookSyncInboxRemove() once it has been acted on.
