/*
 * kosync_sync.h — reading-position sync over KOSync: the WINDOW and the home CLIENT.
 *
 * The protocol itself (routes, JSON, auth, the clock, the config file) is kosync.h and is
 * host-tested; this is the part that needs sockets, the radio and the card.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT A PERSON SEES
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Nothing at all until /books/kosync.txt exists (see kosync.h for its lines). Then:
 *
 *   "Sync my place" (reader menu) opens a WINDOW for 5 minutes: the phone serves KOSync for
 *     THIS book — on its own open hotspot 'WiPhone-Books' (http://192.168.4.1) when it is not
 *     on WiFi, or on its WiFi address when it is. On WiFi with home= set it FIRST READS the
 *     home server and then PUTs the place there — unless the server holds a place from another
 *     device that the offer rule (kosync.h, D1) says is news: that is OFFERED as the card
 *     instead, and ours is not sent over it (pressing again after declining it sends ours) —
 *     and the window opens once that job has its verdict, or after 25 s (kosync.h,
 *     kosyncWindowWaitsForHome: "Asking home first - the window opens after").
 *     While a KOSync place for the book is still on the card, unanswered, it sends nothing.
 *     An X4 (or anything that speaks KOSync) joins and syncs; the
 *     window closes 10 s after a PUT for the book, 120 s after a GET (the peer may be waiting
 *     on a person), or at the deadline — whichever is first.
 *   A PUT from the peer lands as the ORDINARY sync card ("CrossPoint says: they are at N%"),
 *     with its undo, arming and backward warning — it is parked in the booksync inbox as a
 *     locally-signed CBS1 record, so none of that machinery knows KOSync exists.
 *   auto=on         closing a book (or leaving the reader) opens the same 5-minute window
 *                   and pushes home — the push ONLY if the place moved since the book was
 *                   opened or last pushed (kosync.h, D2): an unmoved place must not overwrite
 *                   a newer one another device sent.
 *   open_window=on  opening a book while NOT on WiFi opens a 60 s window, so an X4 already
 *                   waiting in its own "sync" can find the phone.
 *   Opening a book while ON WiFi with home= set asks the home server (partial MD5 first,
 *   then the file-name id) and offers the card per the offer rule. Opened BEFORE the WiFi
 *   came up (right after power-on, say), the same ask is made once it does, while the book
 *   is still open.
 *   The home client never blocks the loop: its connect is polled, and a push or pull that
 *   gets no answer is tried again (KOSYNC_CLIENT_TRIES in all, 1 s and 4 s apart) before it
 *   is given up — and then said so.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE RULES THIS MODULE KEEPS
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * 🛑 THE PHONE ONLY HOSTS. It never scans for, and never joins, anybody else's hotspot:
 *    joining one fires STA_GOT_IP, and SIP, NTP, the SMS mirror and the tile downloader all
 *    wake up into a network with no route. The X4 does the joining.
 * 🛑 NO POSITION IS STORED DIFFERENTLY. The window and the client work on a SNAPSHOT
 *    (KosyncBook) taken from the reader; a peer's place goes into the inbox and is taken, or
 *    not, by a human on the card. positions.cbs, the reading spine and the LoRa record are
 *    untouched.
 * ⚠ OWNED AT FILE SCOPE. BooksApp is new'd on entry and deleted on exit; a window opened
 *    on book close has to outlive it (the same lesson as the booksync inbox), so the window,
 *    its book and the client all live here.
 * ⚠ The window gates the WiFi rescue exactly as the uploader's hotspot does (xferServing() in
 *    WiPhone.ino) — for at most 5 minutes, on a hard millis() deadline that nothing can
 *    extend past what was asked for. It does NOT hold the screen or pin full speed (the uploader
 *    does): it serves with the screen dark, at 80 MHz. It never opens during a Game Boy game
 *    (and a game closes it), nor under Settings > WiFi (which closes it too).
