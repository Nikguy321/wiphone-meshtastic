/*
 * epub_parse.h — EPUB and plain-text parsing, matching COVEY's covey_ui/epub.py.
 *
 * An EPUB is a zip of XHTML. This reads it straight off the SD card: central directory,
 * inflate (ESP32 ROM miniz on the phone, zlib in the host tests), then a deliberately dumb
 * XHTML-to-text pass. No layout, no CSS — a 240x320 panel re-wraps everything anyway.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * POSITION IS (spine, offset), NEVER A PAGE NUMBER
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A page number is a property of THIS screen at THIS font size. COVEY's 480x800 panel and
 * the WiPhone's are not the same, so a page number means nothing across devices — which is
 * the entire problem booksync exists to solve. The portable unit is the spine index plus a
 * character offset into that spine item's extracted text, both of which come out of the
 * file's own structure.
 *
 * ⚠ The offset is only exactly comparable between readers that flatten XHTML identically.
 * Across implementations it drifts by the length of whatever markup one keeps and the other
 * drops — a few characters per paragraph, and more here than on COVEY because this parser
 * decodes a smaller set of HTML entities (see EPUB_ENTITY_NOTE in the .cpp). That drift is
 * expected and handled: booksync also carries the whole-book FRACTION, and epubLocate()
 * turns a fraction back into a position, which is what makes a jump from COVEY land
 * somewhere sane. It is also why a jump is confirmed by the reader rather than taken
 * silently.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * IDENTITY — this is what makes sync match, so it must agree with COVEY exactly
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Three ids, best first, and ANY overlap means "same book":
 *   "id:<slug of dc:identifier>"   absent from plenty of files
 *   "ta:<slug of title|author>"    matches the same book from two different sources
 *   "fp:<content fingerprint>"     matches only a byte-identical copy
 *
 * The filename is NOT an id for an EPUB. It is for a .txt, where the title comes from the
 * filename stem and there is no dc:identifier.
 *
 * Only the FIRST id travels over LoRa, so byte-identical copies on both devices is the
 * happy path — it makes all three agree at once.

 * KOSync — the SECOND spine, which exists only to talk percentages with other readers
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * KOSync (KOReader's sync protocol, which the Xteink X4's CrossPoint firmware and COVEY also
 * speak) moves a position as ONE number: a whole-book percentage. The number the X4 sends is
 * CrossPoint's, BYTE-weighted over CrossPoint's idea of the spine — and that is not this
 * reader's spine. CrossPoint counts every <itemref> naming a manifest item, linear="no"
 * covers and images included, looks each one up by its %XX-DECODED path, and weighs it by
 * its uncompressed size in the zip. The reading spine above skips all three kinds, so the
 * two lists differ in length and in order of magnitude (a 200 KB map image in the spine is
 * two thirds of one fixture's "book" to CrossPoint and nothing at all to us).
 *
 * 🛑 THIS MAP IS ADDITIVE. It never feeds the reading spine, epubFraction/epubLocate, the
 * position store or the LoRa record — those stay spine-EQUAL and byte-for-byte what they
 * were, which is what keeps every saved place where it was across the update (proven by
 * tests/golden_positions.h). A KOSync percentage is made from (spine, offset, chapter
 * length) on the way OUT and turned back into (spine, within) on the way IN, and nowhere
 * else. The rules are pinned by tools/gen_kosync_vectors.py; every number in
 * tests/vectors_kosync.h is reproduced by tests/test_kosync.cpp.
 *
 * Sizes come from the central-directory walk epubOpen already makes to learn which chapters
 * exist, so the map costs ZERO extra card reads. When that walk does not finish, sizes are
 * unknown (sizesKnown=false) and the book is simply not syncable over KOSync — never a
 * guessed total. */
