/*
 * tile_plan.h — the map download's arithmetic and its decisions, with no Arduino in them.
 *
 * tile_fetch.cpp runs the download on a task of its own and cannot be compiled on the Mac;
 * everything here CAN, so the host suite (tests/test_tileplan.cpp) pins it:
 *   - what a job covers and costs: the tile square per level, the tile count, the bytes (64-bit:
 *     20 km to z17 is 6.7 GB, past what a uint32 holds), and the time;
 *   - which depths the Download form's Detail row may offer for a source;
 *   - the order the tiles are fetched in (centre-out, in 16x16 blocks), so a multi-day run that
 *     is cut short still holds the middle;
 *   - whether a stopped job should start again by itself, and if not, why not.
 *
 * ── WHY THE RESUME DECISION IS ONE PURE FUNCTION ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A download can now take days (20 km to z17 on OpenTopoMap is ~51,000 tiles at ~4 s each), and
 * nothing lasting that long survives without a WiFi drop, a call, a game or a restart. So a stopped
 * job starts again by itself — but only under the conditions the form's own Start would accept,
 * on the network it was started on (a hotspot on a trip is someone's phone bill), and never in a
 * loop that grinds the card or reboots the phone. Every one of those gates is a fact the loop can
 * read in microseconds; putting the whole decision here, over plain values, is what lets the host
 * suite walk the table instead of trusting it.
