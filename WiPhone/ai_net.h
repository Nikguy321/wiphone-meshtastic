/*
 * ai_net.h - the device half of Menu > AI: the key file on the card, the saved chat, the
 * remembered daily limits, the gates, and the worker that talks to Google. The decisions are
 * gemini.h's (host-tested); the screens are app_ai.cpp's; the bench is serial `ai`.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ONE QUESTION AT A TIME, ON A WORKER OF ITS OWN
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * TLS cannot run on the loop task (tile_fetch.h, "WHY A TASK"): an 8 KB stack and mbedTLS's two
 * 16.7 KB record buffers. So, exactly like the map downloader:
 *   - ONE persistent worker ("aiworker"), its 8 KB INTERNAL stack carved on the first question and
 *     never freed, waiting on a semaphore. Never a per-run task (a static one races its own TCB on
 *     this FreeRTOS; a dynamic one fragmented `largest` 26 -> 11 KB on phone 1).
 *   - mbedTLS allocates from PSRAM through tile_fetch's hook (tlsInstallPsramHook), installed
 *     before the first WiFiClientSecure - an AI question may be the first TLS since boot.
 *   - Its OWN worker, not tile_fetch's: a map job holds that one for days. A question is refused
 *     while a download runs (two handshakes would dip the internal heap ~24 KB) - see aiAsk.
 * Per question: a new WiFiClientSecure with Google's roots pinned (setCACert: GTS Root R1 + R4,
 * built in and the only ones - no override file), setConnectTimeout(10000) - which also caps the
 * handshake, 120 s by default - and setTimeout(60000) for the answer (uint16: never past 65535),
 * the key in an `x-goog-api-key` header, the chunked body de-chunked by hand into PSRAM (never
 * getString(), which grows on the internal heap), then http.end(), the block closes, stop(),
 * delete. The connection is closed after every answer.
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHAT. The question, its context and a copy of the key go into a module-static PSRAM
 * request on the LOOP (aiAsk) and belong to the worker until it finishes; the worker writes only
 * that request, its result and a small progress record published under a spinlock with a
 * generation counter. The loop folds a finished result into the chat and writes the card
 * (aiLoopTick, every pass - a flag test when idle). So leaving the app mid-question is safe: the
 * worker never touches an app, and the answer is in the chat when the app is opened again.
 *
 * THE CARD. gemini.txt is read from /API Keys/gemini.txt, then /gemini.txt (the T-Deck's place),
 * on every app open and before every question - so a new key works without a reboot - and only a
 * GOOD read is kept: a card that fails a read keeps the last good key rather than turning into
 * "no key". The chat is /ai/chat.txt and the remembered limits /ai/state.txt (never inside
 * /API Keys). Nothing here ever prints, logs or draws the key: `ai` says its length.
