   * minutes, [make] the retry interval a lot less [often]". He had just driven 50 minutes home
   * with no WiFi, and that stretch measured ~106 mV/h against ~60 mV/h associated.
   *
   * ⚠ THE SCANS WERE NEVER THE EXPENSIVE PART — a scan is a few hundred ms. The cost is the
   * JOIN RETRY: WIFI_RETRY_PERIOD_MS is 20 s and eases only to 180 s, and every failed attempt
   * leaves the radio associating for up to 30 s before the quiesce in loop() disconnects it.
   * Out of range that is roughly 20 attempts an hour x 30 s ≈ an 8 % duty cycle at full radio
   * power, on top of the scans. Both cadences read this one predicate so they cannot disagree
   * — the file already learned that lesson once (see scheduleScanRetry).
   *
   * Both escape hatches survive: connecting clears the spell, and a screen wake still forces an
   * immediate scan and an immediate retry, so picking the phone up is prompt however long the
   * spell has run. */
  /* The user's own WiFi switch: true = they turned the radio off to save power.
   *
   * 🔑 EVERY re-enable path must consult this. The 2026-09-01 audit found three that did not
   * — the WiFi list screen's 5 s rescan, the uploader's softAP fallback, and the Game Boy's
   * exit — so "WiFi off" quietly stopped being true partway through a trip. */

  /* Is a join attempt worth the radio time, given what the last scan actually saw?
   *
   * 🔑 THE POINT: a scan is ~350 ms. A failed join holds the radio associating for up to 30 s
   * before the quiesce in loop() disconnects it. Out of range that is the single largest
   * remaining cost, so do not spend it on air we have just been told is empty.

   * 🛑 IT FAILS OPEN, EVERYWHERE, ON PURPOSE. No scan evidence, stale evidence, or not yet in
   * a long dry spell all return true — this may only ever skip a join it has POSITIVE recent
   * evidence is pointless. A phone that will not rejoin is a far worse failure than a phone
   * that wastes some milliamps, and hidden SSIDs never appear in a scan at all.
   *
   * ⚠ AND IT HAS A SAFETY VALVE: every JOIN_BLIND_EVERY skips it lets one attempt through
   * regardless. So a hidden network, or a deaf radio whose scans lie, costs a slower rejoin
   * and never a permanent one. NOT const — the valve counts. */

   * perpetually MID-CONNECT — esp_wifi documents that scans run while the station is
   * connecting are ineffective, and the framework's event-task auto-reconnect retries
