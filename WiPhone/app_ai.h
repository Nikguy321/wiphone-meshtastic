/*
 * app_ai.h - Menu > AI: ask Google's Gemini a question from the keypad, on WiFi, with the
 * owner's own free key on the card (README "AI"). The talking is ai_net.cpp's (a worker of its
 * own, TLS with Google's roots pinned); the rules are gemini.cpp's (host-tested).
 *
 * SCREENS (one enterState() door, which also drops any claim on predictive text):
 *   TRANSCRIPT  the saved chat, paged like the Files viewer (bookLayoutPage + bookRenderRun over
 *               ONE PSRAM buffer): "> question" in blue, the answer in white, under it the model
 *               that answered ("Flash") in grey, a grey "New topic" line where a topic starts.
 *               Opens on the newest page. Up/Down page; OK asks; Select = the menu; Back leaves.
 *   MENU        Ask a question / New topic / Clear chat... / Key info.
 *   CONFIRM     Clear chat: "Yes, delete it" / "No".
 *   COMPOSE     the Meshtastic compose screen's rules: a MultilineTextWidget (500 characters),
 *               predictive text claimed AFTER setInputState, the counter strip. Send = CALL or the
 *               left soft key ("Ask"); END cancels; OK is a typing key and is swallowed; Back is
 *               backspace ("Clear"). A refused question stays typed, the reason in the strip.
 *   WAITING     the transcript with the question at the bottom and a status box: the stage
 *               ("Asking Gemini...", "Google is busy - trying again... 2 s"), the model, the
 *               seconds since it was asked. END cancels (the answer is thrown away when it lands);
 *               Back leaves the app and the question carries on - the answer is in the chat when
 *               the app is opened again.
 *   KEYINFO     where the key comes from and what the phone found: the file, "key: set (N chars)",
 *               the model - NEVER the key or any part of it (screenshots get shared). The first
 *               screen when there is no key. "Add key file over WiFi" starts the uploader into
 *               /API Keys (XFER).
 *   XFER        the uploader's address, like Files' upload screen, with the warning that the
 *               phone's own hotspot is OPEN. Back stops it and reads the key again.
 *
 * MEMORY. This runs on the loop task, whose 8 KB stack a Books picture page already takes ~7.6 KB
 * of: no big locals here. The transcript, its styles, the page and the line being drawn are
 * members (the app object is PSRAM: WiPhoneApp's operator new).
