 * goes into the SMALLEST free block that holds it, at that block's low end, and multi_heap never
 * moves it after. The Game Boy's startGame() allocates its task stacks, VRAM and audio buffer
 * (32 KB) at the bottom of the phone's one big free block BEFORE its setMonoOutput() reinstalls
 * this ring. On phone 1 (the boot ring before the game) what was left of the big block, 30,896 B,
 * was then SMALLER than the 32,860 B hole the old ring left, so best fit put 7 of the 8 new
 * buffers right on top of the emulator's blocks and the 8th in the old hole (in-game largest
 * 28,740 = that hole less one buffer, to the byte). When the game ends the emulator's blocks free
 * BELOW the ring and the big block stays cut in two for the rest of the boot: largest 63,716 ->
 * 32,816 on phone 1 (exactly the four emulator blocks, 32,768 + 4 x 12 B of heap poisoning) and
 * 64,152 -> 28,732 on phone 2, with free back where it was. Proven by music's own install on
 * phone 2 moving the ring away: largest 28,732 -> 64,316, so nothing else was left in the block.
 *
 * Reinstalled here once the borrower's blocks are gone, best fit sees the heap the way it was
 * before the game: the old ring's hole (the smaller block) takes the buffers again and the big
 * block is whole. ⚠ Through installI2S(), never a bare uninstall: its cache must stay true (see
 * the note there). It FREES before it installs, so free RAM never dips below where it started
 * and the new buffers always have a home (the eight they just left, at least).
 *
 * Stopped after, if the device is off: i2s_driver_install() starts the DMA (i2s_set_clk ends in
 * i2s_start), and the ring it replaces was stopped by shutdown(). A stopped fresh ring has an
 * empty queue and the DMA at buffer 0, which is what the next start() expects.
 * ⚠ Only with the device OFF: a powered codec losing its clocks under it clicks.
 * ⚠ A FAILED install here leaves NO driver (the old ring was freed first): false, with i2sReady()
 * now false, which the caller's log line tells apart from a refusal. Not retried here - the heap
 * that just refused would refuse again; start() installs one on the next use, or refuses. */

   * The TODO that used to sit here ("does it create pop noise? if so - reduce number of
   * calls") was asking for this, and there is a second, larger reason to do it.
   *
   * Every call uninstalls and reinstalls the driver, which frees and reallocates its DMA
   * ring in INTERNAL, DMA-capable RAM: dma_buf_count(4) x dma_buf_len(1024, which IDF caps at
   * 1023 in stereo) x 2ch x 2B for TX, and the same again for RX — ~32 KB in stereo, ~16 KB in
   * mono. Internal contiguous RAM is the resource whose exhaustion panics this phone, and
   * callers arrive in clusters: starting a track sets rate, channels and mono in sequence, so
   * one play could churn it several times over. Measured on hardware: starting music dropped
   * the largest free block 15,648 -> 8,200, and the MusicApp object itself accounted for
   * only 224 of that.
   *
   * So: install only when the driver is not installed, or when something it depends on has
   * actually changed. Callers can keep calling this as "make I2S match my settings" — which
   * is what every one of them means — without paying for a teardown each time.
   *
   * 🛑 0.9.79: THERE ARE TWO GEOMETRIES NOW, AND ONLY MUSIC ASKS FOR ITS OWN. Music installs
   * mono, TX only, MUSIC_DMA_BUFS x MUSIC_DMA_BUF_SAMPLES (24 KB; see music_feed.h). Every other
   * path — configureI2S(), which every setter calls — asks for the DEFAULT one, so a pop, a
   * ring, a call or the Game Boy that follows a track gets a reinstall back to it instead of
   * inheriting music's ring. (The Game Boy is paced by the DMA draining; a call reads the
   * microphone, and music's install has no RX.) turnMicOn() calls configureI2S() for the same
   * reason: the mic-level meters never call a setter.
   *
   * ⚠ Safe to cache because NOTHING ELSE installs or uninstalls the driver: start() uses
   * i2s_start() and shutdown() uses i2s_stop(), neither of which uninstalls. Verified by
   * grep over the whole tree. If that ever stops being true, this cache goes stale and the
   * symptom is silence, so re-check it before adding an uninstall anywhere else. */

/* ── SNAPSHOT AND PUT BACK THE OUTPUT CONFIGURATION ───────────────────────────────────
 * Declared in Audio.h from the beginning with a bare "TODO" and never implemented — which
 * is why one-shot sounds have been permanently reconfiguring the device.
 *
 * playPop() sets SIX parameters (channels, bits, rate, mono, headphones, speaker, volumes)
 * and the pop teardown in WiPhone.ino only called ceasePlayback(), restoring none of them.
 * So a single Meshtastic notification left the phone at 8 kHz, mono, loudspeaker-forced and
 * at maximum volume, for good. Two measured consequences:
 *   - music afterwards played MONO OUT OF THE LOUDSPEAKER with headphones plugged in,
 *     because music_player's wantStereo() read audio->getHeadphones() (gone in 0.9.79:
 *     music is always mono now, and only the route follows the jack);
 *   - monoOut = true is exactly what paces the Game Boy at 50% (it is clocked by a blocking
 *     i2s_write, so a mono sink drains at half rate — see app_gbc.cpp). A mesh message was a
 *     far more frequent trigger for that than the music player ever was.
 *
 * ⚠ configureI2S() UNINSTALLS AND REINSTALLS THE I2S DRIVER, which reallocates ~16 KB of
 * internal DMA buffers. Internal heap is this phone's scarcest resource and fragmenting it is
 * what causes the reset_reason=4 panics, so restore() does that AT MOST ONCE and only when
 * something actually differs. Putting the values back through the individual setters would
 * have cost several reinstalls per notification — worse than the bug being fixed.
 *
 * ⚠ `playback` is deliberately NOT preserved. ceasePlayback() closes the playing file, so
 * restoring the enum would point the decoder at a dead handle. A pop still stops the current
 * track; that is a separate issue and is NOT fixed here. */

   * i2s_set_sample_rates() is i2s_set_clk(): with the bits unchanged it keeps the DMA ring and
   * its free-buffer queue, then i2s_stop() + i2s_start() — the DMA restarts at buffer 0 while the
   * queue stays in its old finish order, so the next trip round the ring plays SCRAMBLED
   * (music_feed.h; tests/test_musicfeed.cpp, "pause and resume on the same ring").
   *   - i2sRate follows the hardware (musicDma() and a later configureI2S() read it): the old
   *     cache kept the install-time rate, and a later configureI2S() asking for THAT rate
   *     "matched" and left the hardware at this one.
   *   - i2sQueueStale makes the next configureI2S() REINSTALL even when everything else
   *     matches. Without it (a2aa516), every sequence that ends in setMonoOutput(true) — a pop,
   *     the ringtone, a call's audio — found the mono default already in after a music session
   *     and skipped the reinstall, so from the second pop on the 300 ms chirp came late, out of
   *     order and cut short by its stop timer. 0.9.78 got a fresh ring there by accident (the
   *     stale rate never matched); this gets it on purpose, at the same one reinstall a pop
   *     (playPop() and playRingtone() set the rate FIRST so the reinstall that follows is the
   *     only one, even straight after music's own ring).
   *   - An UNCHANGED rate touches nothing: no restart, nothing to go stale. A call sets its rate
   *     for the microphone and again for the far end's stream (sendRtpStreamFromMic() then
   *     playRtpStream()), and the second used to restart the ring under the first trip of it.
