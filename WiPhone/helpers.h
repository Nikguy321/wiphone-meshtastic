/* 🛑 NEVER CALL WiFiUDP::parsePacket() DIRECTLY. Use this instead.
 *
 * parsePacket() allocates a 1,460-byte buffer with `new char[1460]` on EVERY call, from the
 * INTERNAL heap, and the framework's own guard immediately underneath it:
 *
 *     char * buf = new char[1460];
 *     if(!buf){ return 0; }            <-- DEAD CODE
 *
 * never fires, because `new[]` THROWS on failure rather than returning null. Nothing catches
 * it, so the throw becomes std::terminate() -> abort() -> reset_reason=4. The framework author
 * wrote a graceful bail-out using malloc semantics and got a device-killing abort instead.
 *
 * This phone has ~20 KB of internal heap in total, so 1,460 CONTIGUOUS bytes is a real ask. It
 * went unnoticed while nothing polled UDP often; the moment a SIP account was registered,
 * TinySIP::checkCall() began polling it from the main loop and the phone panicked every one to
 * three minutes. Proven on hardware 2026-08-16 by decoding the panic backtrace:
 *
 *     loop -> TinySIP::checkCall -> UDP_SIPConnection::available -> WiFiUDP::parsePacket
 *          -> operator new[] -> __cxa_throw -> std::terminate -> abort
 *
 * Two layers, because either alone is insufficient:
 *   1. Refuse to call it when the largest internal block cannot comfortably hold the buffer.
 *      This is what prevents the abort in practice.
 *   2. Catch std::bad_alloc anyway — WiFi runs on the other core and can take the memory
 *      between our check and the allocation. Rare, but it is precisely the race that would
 *      otherwise kill the device at random.
 *
 * The cost of refusing is ONE dropped packet. UDP is unreliable by definition and every caller
 * here re-polls, so it is re-read next pass or retransmitted by the far end. */

/* 🛑 NEVER CALL WiFi.scanNetworks() DIRECTLY. Ask wifiScanMemoryOk() first.
 *
 * The same bug as parsePacket() above, in a different framework file — and this is the one
 * that actually killed a phone. WiFiScanClass::_scanDone() does:
 *
 *     _scanResult = new wifi_ap_record_t[_scanCount];
 *     if (!_scanResult || ...) { _scanCount = 0; }        <-- DEAD CODE, new[] THROWS
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT CANNOT BE CAUGHT AT THE CALL SITE. _scanDone() runs on the WiFi event task, not
 * on the loop, so unlike udpParsePacketSafe() there is no try/catch we can wrap round it.
 * The ONLY lever the firmware has is deciding not to start the scan.
 *
 * MEASURED on phone 1, 2026-08-29, three scans, off the DROP instrument:
 *     n=19 APs -> largest fell 3,648    n=19 -> 3,648    n=18 -> 3,536
 * i.e. ~192 bytes of CONTIGUOUS internal heap per access point. ⚠ That is deliberately NOT
 * sizeof(wifi_ap_record_t) (~80 bytes): the driver allocates alongside the array while the
 * scan runs, and the number that predicts the crash is the total effect on `largest`.
 *
 * THE CRASH, exactly: the phone died with largest = 3,072 and "[autosw] scan started" as the
 * last line in the log. 19 APs needed 3,648. There were 3,072.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A PREDICTION, NOT A GUARANTEE, and it is important to know which. The AP count
 * comes from the PREVIOUS scan; the allocation happens later, on another task, in an
 * environment that may have gained access points since. It turns "certain death in a dense
 * area on a fragmented phone" into "unlikely" — the same trade udpParsePacketSafe() makes,
 * for the same reason, and it is the best available: the count cannot be known in advance.
 *
 * The cost of refusing is ONE skipped scan. The phone stays on the AP it is already using,
 * and the normal backoff brings the next attempt round shortly. */

/* Tell the guard how many APs the last completed scan actually found, so the next estimate

/* Description:
 *     Since SIP protocol relies on random tags, we need a good and fast random number generator.
 *     This structure implements Permuted Congruential Generator (pcg32_fast) algorithm, as well as collects random bits from hardware events for the seed.
 *     In our tests this implementation sometimes significantly outperforms the standard Mersenne Twister (std::19937) on ESP32, in other cases - performs slighly worse.
 *       This is because MT performance is unstable. Not clear why.
 *     This implementation generates 10M numbers in around 2645 ms, while std::mt19937 needs between 2441 and 3398 ms depending on the exact use case.
