/* The T9 EXTRA dictionary — your own words, from the SD card.
 *
 * `/t9-extra.txt`, one lowercase word per line, already sorted by keypad digit key (see
 * tools/gen_t9_extra.py, which writes it). Loaded ONCE at boot into PSRAM and handed to the
 * engine as a second table whose matches come after the built-in ones. So jargon — unit
 * names, callsigns, place names, a team roster — is always reachable on the candidate list
 * and never displaces an ordinary English word.
 *
 * 🛑 PSRAM, AND READ EXACTLY ONCE. The file is ~70 KB and the pointer array another ~35 KB;
 * that is nothing against 3.6 MB of PSRAM and utterly fatal on the ~20 KB internal heap. The
 * read is at BOOT and never on the keypress path — a filesystem access per keystroke is the
 * 1.5 s freeze this firmware has fought before, and it is why the built-in dictionary lives
 * in flash rather than on the card.
 *
 * EVERY FAILURE IS SILENT AND HARMLESS. No card, no file, a malformed file, no PSRAM: the
 * table stays empty, the engine is never given one, and predictive text works exactly as it
 * does on a phone that never had the file. There is no state in which this can panic, and
 * none in which it can make the phone worse than not having it.
