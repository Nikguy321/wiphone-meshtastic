/* files_paths.h — the path arithmetic behind the Files app's folder operations, kept in a

 *
 * A folder can now be copied, moved and deleted from the phone (Nick, 2026-09-20: "there is
 * no way to select a folder and copy/paste/delete... found it out when trying to delete
 * 'home' in the maps folder"). Every one of those is a tree walk that ends in unlink(), and
 * the questions that decide whether it is SAFE are pure string questions: is the destination
 * inside the source (a copy of /maps into /maps/x never ends); does the clipboard point into
 * the tree being deleted (a paste of a ghost); is this the card's root. Getting a prefix test
 * wrong here — "/maps/home" matching "/maps/homely" — deletes the wrong folder, so the tests
 * pin the boundaries.
 *
 * ⚠ Deliberately free of every Arduino and ESP-IDF header. Keep it that way.
