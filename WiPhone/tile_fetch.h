/*
 * tile_fetch.h — pulling map tiles off the network onto the card, from a task of their own.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY A TASK, AND WHY THE ALLOCATOR HOOK
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Measured 2026-09-18 on WiPhone 2 (0.9.63): an HTTPS pull of one USGS tile through the
 * uploader's /fetch path FAILED in start_ssl_client() with -32512 (SSL - Memory allocation
 * failed), took the internal heap's min-ever from 19,860 to 2,676 bytes, and left the largest
 * block fragmented at 19,160 for the rest of the session. Two causes, both in the precompiled
 * framework and neither fixable from a sketch the ordinary way:
 *
 *   1. CONFIG_MBEDTLS_INTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC=y — every mbedTLS allocation comes from INTERNAL RAM,
 *      and mbedtls_ssl_setup() wants two 16,717-byte record buffers before the handshake even
 *      starts. 33.4 KB against a phone whose largest free block idles at ~25 KB.
 *   2. The handshake runs on the CALLING task's stack, and the loop task has 8 KB total
 *      (CONFIG_ARDUINO_LOOP_STACK_SIZE, baked into sdkconfig.h) with a measured floor of a few
 *      hundred bytes. TLS from loop() is impossible independent of heap.
 *
 * The escape, MEASURED the same night (`tlstest`, 70 kept-alive HTTPS GETs of a USGS tile,
 * every one a JPEG): esp_config.h defines MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_MEMORY, so mbedtls_calloc is a
 * function POINTER and libmbedtls.a exports mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free(). Install a
 * PSRAM calloc once and every mbedTLS object — record buffers, contexts, the parsed
 * certificate chain — lands in the 3.4 MB that is actually free; PSRAM came back to the byte
 * afterwards. It is global: nothing else in this firmware allocates through mbedTLS
 * (mesh_crypto and the hashes use stack contexts), hardware AES is CPU-fed (no DMA, so PSRAM
 * operands are fine) and MPI/SHA are software. The work runs on a task with its own INTERNAL
 * stack (IDF 3.3 cannot place task stacks in PSRAM), allocated ONCE and never freed — the Game
 * Boy's rule, app_gbc.cpp:138-160. The handshake used ~4.2 KB of it; 10 KB is the margin.
 * The price: ~10 KB of internal RAM for the life of the firmware from the first download,
 * a handshake of ~1.5 s once per area (keep-alive after that: ~250 ms per tile), and a
 * transient internal dip to ~4 KB during the handshake — which is why a download PAUSES for
 * a call (tileFetchPause) rather than sharing the heap with SIP audio.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT ONE TILE COSTS, AND WHERE
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * GET (kept-alive) -> body in PSRAM -> sniff -> decode to a PSRAM 256x256 RGB565 -> write
 * /maps/<source>/<z>/<x>/<y>.tmp in four 32 KB pieces -> SD.rename to .565. The rename is
 * what makes a power-off mid-tile harmless: the viewer never sees a wrong-length file, and
 * the next run's skip test (size == 131072, NOT existence) repairs any hole.
 *
 * The task writes the card itself. The SPI bus is serialised at the HAL (TFT_eSPI force-
 * enables SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS on ESP32; SD wraps every sector in AcquireSPI) and FatFs is
 * built FF_FS_REENTRANT, so a tile write cannot interleave bytes with a screen push — it can
 * only DELAY one. A whole tile is written between two draws rather than a sector at a time
 * for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Internal RAM per tile: the WiFiClient's 1.4 KB RX buffer and HTTPClient's URL strings.
 * Everything else — body, decoded tile, decoder pools — is PSRAM.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MULTI-DAY JOBS (0.9.78)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * OpenTopoMap has a real z17, and 20 km of it is ~51,000 tiles: about 2.4 days at the phone's
 * ~4 s a tile. Nothing lasts that long without a WiFi drop, a call, a game or a restart, so:
 *   - a job is PERSISTED in NVS (source key, network name, centre, radius, depth, and a cursor
 *     saved at most every 500 tiles / 5 minutes / level end) and a stopped one is RESUMED by the
 *     loop (tileFetchTick) under the rules of tile_plan.h — the same gates as Start, on the same
 *     network, with cool-downs after failures and a strike count against reboot loops;
 *   - within a level the tiles go centre-out in 16x16 blocks (tile_plan.h), so a run cut short
 *     holds the middle; a resume starts at the cursor instead of re-testing every tile;
 *   - a run that reaches the end with holes makes ONE second pass over what did not land;
 *   - a user Stop is final: it forgets the NVS job at once, not when the worker gets round to
 *     exiting (that can be 20 s: a 15 s HTTP timeout plus the card's write retries).
 * Every NVS read and write happens on the LOOP task (the tick, Start, Stop): the worker only
 * publishes its cursor, under a spinlock, for the tick to save.
