/* menu_wrap.h — breaking a display-only menu note into rows that fit, kept in a header of its
 * own so the HOST SUITE can test the code the firmware executes (the menu_marquee.h pattern).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: a note whose length the numbers decide — "12853 tiles, 1606 MB, about 257 min",
 * "Last run: 5517 new, 7332 already had, 4 failed, 7013 s", an error handed up from the tile
 * fetcher — used to be one row ending in `..`, and the part cut off was the part that mattered
 * (Nick, on the Maps download screen, 2026-09-20). The selected-row marquee does not help: a
 * note is read, not selected. So it wraps: break at the last space that fits, next row, until
 * the text is out. MenuWidget::addNoteWrapped (GUI.cpp) supplies the font measurement and adds
 * the rows; this file holds the breaking, which is the part that can be wrong quietly (a break
 * inside a word, an infinite loop on a word wider than the row, a lost last word).
 *
 * ⚠ Deliberately free of every Arduino and ESP-IDF header. Keep it that way; that constraint
 * is what makes it testable at all.
