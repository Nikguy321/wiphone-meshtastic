/*
 * music_feed.h — how music gets from the card to the DAC without gaps, and an honest count
 * of the times it did not.
 *
 * Arduino-free, like mp3_stream and wav_reader: tests/test_musicfeed.cpp compiles THIS file,
 * the real helix decoder and the real Mp3Stream on the Mac and drives them against a model of
 * ESP-IDF 3.3's I2S DMA with simulated loop passes. Audio::loop() calls pass() once per main-
 * loop pass; Audio supplies the file (MusicSource) and the DMA (MusicSink). Nothing here
 * touches a peripheral.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG (0.9.78 and before, measured 2026-09-25) ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. "gaps" WAS ARITHMETIC, NOT A DROPOUT METER. The feed read at most 512 bytes per call and
 *     ended the pass the first time a decode lacked input. A 192 kbps / 44.1 kHz frame is 627
 *     bytes, so the stream HAD to take (24,000 - 38.28 x 512) / 512 = 8.6 extra input-limited
 *     passes a second, each one "starved and never refused" = +1 gap. Phone 2 read 8-9/s on
 *     every 192k file at 160 MHz AND 240 MHz, and 0.9.78 read 167 in 19 s: the Mac replay of
 *     the same file reads 163. With ZERO true dropouts at passes up to 30 ms. It was also blind
 *     the other way: Hells_Bells (128k) read 0 gaps through screenshots that each stalled the
 *     loop 4.2 s and certainly emptied the DMA.
 *  2. THE REAL DROPOUTS: any loop pass longer than what the DMA held. It was 4 x 1023 stereo
 *     frames at 44.1 kHz, and the IDF 3.3 driver only ever lets a writer get dma_buf_count - 1
 *     buffers ahead (its free queue is xQueueCreate(dma_buf_count - 1)), so ~70 ms. The once-a-
 *     second Now Playing repaint, a map frame (~77 ms), a Files slice (80 ms), a mesh DB save
 *     (~0.1 s on the card) each ate it. The LOOP STALL line only fires above 250 ms.
 *  3. When the ring does run dry, IDF 3.3 mostly REPLAYS old buffers rather than playing
 *     silence (tx_desc_auto_clear only zeroes a buffer when its free queue is full, and a
 *     writer holding a half-filled buffer keeps it from ever being full) — so a dropout sounds
 *     like a stutter, not a click.
 *
 * ── THE DESIGN: MORE SECONDS OF RING PER BYTE OF INTERNAL RAM, FED BY WHOLE FRAMES ──────────
 *
 * The DMA ring is the only slack music has (the loop is the only thing that writes I2S; a
 * PSRAM buffer would sit idle through the very stall it was meant to cover), and it must live
 * in INTERNAL, DMA-capable RAM, the resource whose exhaustion panics this phone. So the ring is
 * made to hold more TIME, not more bytes. Nick, 2026-09-25: "Lower audio quality and having to
 * take time to load in-between tracks are things I can live with."
 *   - MONO: (L+R)/2. Half the bytes per sample. The loudspeaker is one speaker anyway.
 *   - HALF RATE for 44.1/48 kHz files (22.05/24 kHz out) through a 23-tap half-band filter
 *     (flat to 8 kHz, -0.9 dB at 9 kHz, -28 dB above 13.7 kHz, -63 dB above 15.4 kHz). Half the
 *     samples per second. Files at 32 kHz and below play at their own rate.
 *   - 24 buffers x 512 samples = 24 KB, TX ONLY (music never reads the microphone). 23 usable
 *     = 534 ms at 22.05 kHz, 490 ms at 24 kHz, 368 ms at 32 kHz — against ~70 ms before. For
 *     scale: the boot install the phone idles with is 4 x 4092 B TX + the same RX = 32 KB, so
 *     this is 8 KB LESS than that; the mono install a pop or a call leaves is 16 KB (so 8 KB
 *     more than loudspeaker music took before). Each buffer is its own 1 KB allocation, which
 *     fits into holes a 4 KB one cannot.
 *   - WHOLE FRAMES: a pass never ends for lack of bytes. The compressed buffer is topped up to
 *     4 KB (in one read) whenever it falls under 2 KB — at least one of the largest possible
 *     frames (1,441 B) is always there.
 *   - A BUDGET per pass (4 frames, 8 when the ring is under 80%), so music never holds the loop
 *     for long: at most ~37 ms a pass including the card reads, ~73 ms catching up after a stall
 *     (the replay's costs: decode 7.65 ms a frame at 160 MHz, a card read 330 us + 1.95 us/B).
 *     Normally a pass does one frame or none. ⚠ The 80% is load-bearing (review, 2026-09-25):
 *     at LONG passes (a map pan is ~77 ms, a Files slice 80 ms) the pass plus its own decode
 *     needs ~4.2-4.8 frames, so 4 cannot keep up and the ring SETTLES at the catch-up mark. At
 *     40% that left ~200 ms of lead and any extra ~200 ms stall ran it dry (the replay: 4-5
 *     dropouts in 180 s at 77 ms + 300 ms every 10 s); at 80% it settles at ~430 ms and the same
 *     runs are clean. The work per second is set by the audio rate either way; only the level
 *     the ring settles at moves. (120 ms passes at 48 kHz still lose: 8 frames a pass is the CPU.)
 *   - tests/test_musicfeed.cpp, with the real decoder on a 192 kbps-shaped stream against a model
 *     of the IDF 3.3 DMA: zero true dropouts at passes of 5-80 ms, at 10 ms + a 100 ms stall
 *     every second, 300 ms every 10 s and 450 ms every 5 s, and at 77 or 100 ms passes + 300 ms
 *     every 10 s (the old feed: 4.8/s at 50 ms passes, 1.1/s at the 100 ms stall). This is the design the host replay called "F4". (A decode task
 *     was the other candidate: it is not needed for CPU — decode is ~30% of one core at 160 MHz —
 *     and it would put a second I2S writer beside the Audio singleton, which every pop, ring,
 *     call and game borrows.)
 *
 * ── THE COUNTER: drops, and why it cannot lie in the direction that matters ─────────────────
 * The IDF 3.3 driver reports no underrun (its optional event queue says only "a buffer
 * finished"). So the lead — how much audio the ring holds — is BOUNDED from both sides with
 * the only two facts the writer has:
 *   - a write that comes back short means the ring is full RIGHT NOW: every buffer but the one
 *     playing is ours, so the lead is between (bufs-1) x len and bufs x len;
 *   - between writes, the DMA drains exactly `rate` samples a second (the APLL; it never stops
 *     while I2S runs, dry or not).
 * `drops` counts passes that found the upper bound below zero: the ring CERTAINLY ran dry (no
 * false positives — it can under-count a dropout shorter than one buffer, 23 ms, and one stall
 * is one drop). `minLead` is the lowest LOWER bound seen at a pass start: while it stays above
 * zero there was certainly no dropout at all. `drops > 0` = proven gaps; `minLead > 0` = proven
 * clean; anything between is "possibly a gap shorter than one buffer". tests/test_musicfeed.cpp
 * checks both claims against the model's ground truth, 24,000 times over random passes and
 * stalls. ⚠ AFTER A DROP, `drops` IS ONLY A LOWER BOUND UNTIL THE RING IS NEXT FULL: the upper
 * bound restarts at "full" and only a short write pins it again, so a second dry spell inside
 * that refill shows in minLead, not in drops — and at long passes, where the writer never meets
 * a full ring, that can be the rest of the track. On the bench judge a busy run by minLead > 0,
 * never by drops == 0 alone. Any stall longer than the ring itself (534 ms at 22.05 kHz, 490 ms
 * at 24 kHz) is a dropout by construction: the ring is the only slack a loop-fed design has.
 *
 * ── TWO IDF 3.3 DRIVER HABITS THE REST OF AUDIO.CPP HAS TO ALLOW FOR ─────────────────────────
 *   - A freshly installed ring plays itself (zeros) once before anything written reaches the
 *     DAC: its free-buffer queue starts EMPTY and fills one buffer per EOF. So the first track
 *     after a pop, a call or a game starts after up to half a second of silence.
 *   - i2s_start() restarts the DMA at buffer 0 but keeps the free queue as it was — so after
 *     the idle watchdog's i2s_stop() the writer fills buffers in an order the DMA no longer plays
 *     them in. playMusic() installs a fresh ring then (Audio::configureMusicI2S()).
