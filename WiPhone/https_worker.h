/*
 * https_worker.h - the ONE task that talks HTTPS for the phone's apps (0.9.81): Menu > AI's
 * questions (ai_net.cpp) and the Almanac's weather (weather_net.cpp), as JOB KINDS on one worker.
 * The map downloader keeps its own (tile_fetch.cpp: a map job holds that one for days).
 *
 * WHY ONE, SHARED (generalised from the AI's own worker, 2026-10-03):
 *   - every worker costs an 8 KB INTERNAL stack carved once and kept for life, and internal RAM is
 *     what this phone runs out of;
 *   - two TLS handshakes at once dip the internal heap ~24 KB (~12 KB of lwIP buffers each): one
 *     worker serialises them for free - the AI and the weather QUEUE behind each other, never
 *     two handshakes at once (a job submitted while the other kind runs waits; the AI goes first
 *     when both wait - it is the one a person is staring at);
 *   - every loop hook keys on one predicate: netRequestActive() puts a job in WiPhone.ino's `busy`,
 *     its `hardBusy` (the handshake runs at 160 MHz with WiFi on, never at the 80 MHz idle clock)
 *     and the loop's 10-tick sleep (the worker gets ~90 % of the core: a 1-tick loop beside a
 *     handshake failed 3 of 3 on phone 1).
 * The worker is pinned to core 1 at priority 1 (the loop's core and priority), waits on a binary
 * semaphore, and runs each queued job's function to its end. Never a per-run task: a static one
 * races its own TCB on this FreeRTOS, a dynamic one fragmented `largest` 26 -> 11 KB on phone 1.
 *
 * THE REQUEST (netHttps): one HTTPS exchange on a FRESH WiFiClientSecure - HTTPClient reuses any
 * connected socket whatever host the next URL names (tile_fetch.h), so a socket never outlives its
 * request. DNS first (hostByName: "no internet" told apart from a refusal); then, when asked, the
 * internal-heap bar is checked again right before the handshake (10 KB largest / 14 KB free:
 * tile_fetch's TF_CONNECT_*); then either HTTPClient connects (the AI: its path as it always was)
 * or the client connects FIRST - c->connect(host, 443, timeout) - so the handshake is timed alone,
 * AFTER http.begin() (begin on a connected client stop()s it: a second, untimed handshake) and
 * sendRequest rides that connection. setConnectTimeout caps TCP + the handshake (WiFiClientSecure
 * passes it on as handshake_timeout, 120 s by default). The body - chunked de-chunked by hand, or a
 * Content-Length one - goes into the caller's PSRAM sink, never getString() (which grows on the
 * internal heap), and is READ TO ITS END even past the sink's cap (the cap's excess is dropped and
 * flagged; a tap sees every byte - the weather counts alerts it cannot keep). mbedTLS allocates
 * from PSRAM through tile_fetch's hook, installed before the first WiFiClientSecure.
