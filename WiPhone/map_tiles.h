/*
 * map_tiles.h — the arithmetic behind the Maps app: Web Mercator, the slippy-tile
 * grid, and the rectangles that carry a tile onto the screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, FREE OF ARDUINO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything here is pure: integers, doubles, and no hardware. That is deliberate and it is
 * the same bargain mesh_pos.h struck — tests/test_maptiles.cpp compiles THESE SOURCES on the
 * host and checks them against values computed independently, so the map's geometry is proven
 * before a phone is involved. A map that is one tile out is not obviously wrong on a 240x320
 * screen; it just quietly shows you the wrong woods. That class of bug has to be caught by
 * arithmetic, not by looking.
 *
 * ── THE VIEW IS AN INTEGER, NOT A FLOAT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🛑 The view centre is stored as WORLD PIXELS at the current zoom (int32), never as a
 * lat/lon pair. Panning is then integer addition and is exactly reversible: press right then
 * left and you are on the same pixel you started on. Storing lat/lon and re-projecting every
 * press accumulates float error in the projection's `log(tan(...))`, and it drifts fastest at
 * the latitudes furthest from the equator — i.e. everywhere anyone actually hunts. Latitude
 * and longitude are computed at the EDGES only: when the view is saved, when the crosshair is
 * read out, and when a pin is projected.
 *
 * World pixels at zoom z run 0 .. 256*2^z in both axes. At the MAP_ZOOM_MAX of 19 that is
 * 134,217,728 — comfortably inside int32, which is why int32 is enough and int64 is not
 * needed anywhere below. The intermediate `wx + vw` sums are still done in int64 so that a
 * viewport hanging off the right-hand edge cannot overflow on the way to being wrapped.
 *
 * ── X WRAPS, Y CLAMPS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Longitude is a circle and latitude is not. Panning east past 180 deg comes back at -180
 * (the tile column index is taken modulo the world width); panning north past the top stops.
 * Mercator cannot represent the poles at all, so latitude is clamped to +/-85.0511287798066
 * deg — the latitude at which the projection is exactly square, and the value every slippy
 * map on earth uses.
