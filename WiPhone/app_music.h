/*
 * app_music.h — the music player's screen.
 *
 * A view onto musicPlayerXxx(), which owns the library, the queue and whatever is
 * playing. This file owns only what a person sees and presses, which is why backing out
 * of it does not stop the music: there is nothing here to stop.
 *
 * Library -> Now playing, plus "Add music over WiFi" on the shared transfer server and a
 * menu for shuffle and repeat.
 *
 * ⚠ Unlike the reader, this does NOT hold the screen awake. A book needs the screen on
 * because reading it is the point; music does not, and holding a phone's screen on for
 * the length of an album is how you arrive somewhere with a flat battery.
