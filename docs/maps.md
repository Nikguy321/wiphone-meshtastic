# Maps on the WiPhone

**Menu → Maps.** An offline map: tiles off the SD card, pins you drop yourself, and
everything the mesh already knows about where people are, on one screen.

The Meshtastic screens already carry every fact this draws — camp is a waypoint, the truck is
a waypoint, everyone's position arrives on port 3, and the Nodes list turns it into
"3.2km E of camp · 4 min ago". That sentence is correct and it is the wrong shape for the
question people actually ask, which is *is he on the other side of the creek or this side*.

It needs no radio traffic of its own and no GPS. With neither, it still shows the places the
mesh has shared and the last position of everyone who has spoken.

## Keys

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Arrows** | scroll. A tap is a **12 px nudge**, always — taps never speed up; **hold one down and it keeps scrolling and speeds up** (after 400 ms, 240 → 480 → 720 → 960 px/s over the next 0.6 s — by TIME, so a frame that comes late moves further, not later, at ~12 frames a second; since 0.9.73); let go and the next press is a nudge again. A hold also rides through the keypad chip's habit of reporting a release and a re-press 4 ms apart under a thumb that never moved (0.9.73 — it used to stop the sweep dead after one to four jumps). With **Snap to markers** on (the menu; it is on by default) the map snaps onto a pin, a place from the mesh or a node with a position **when the crosshair lands within 10 px of it** — after a tap, or where a hold stops. Nothing else: a marker in the path of a sweep is sailed past, and the tap after a snap steps clear (the nudge is bigger than the radius), so you can scroll around them. Since taps on the two axes can put the crosshair within 8.5 px of anything, "as near as you can get" is always near enough. The strip says what you landed on: `Pin 3 (3 of 4)`, `hunt camp (place from the mesh)`, `Nick H (node, 12m ago)`. `7` / `9` walk your pins in order |
| **2 4 6 8** | scroll too, for gloves |
| **Side button 1 / 2** (top two) | zoom in / out. Also `#`/`*` or `3`/`1` |
| **Side button 3** | centre on me: a live GPS fix (4+ satellites), else the pin you declared by hand. Also `0` |
| **Side button 4** (bottom) | the next map type — the same switch as **Menu → Map area**, one press at a time, round and round (`usgs-topo` → `usgs-img` → `otm` → …). The ground under the crosshair stays put; the strip says which map you are on. With one map on the card it says so |
| **OK** | drop a pin on the crosshair and name it — or, with a pin under the crosshair, open it (rename / move / share / delete). Also `5` |
| **Menu** (top-left soft key) | **What the buttons do...** is its first row — the phone's buttons drawn with what each does. Then download maps, go to coordinates, follow me, measure (an anchor at the crosshair; scroll away and the strip reads the distance and bearing), **Snap to markers: ON/off**, pins, places, nodes — the three lists are **nearest-first** with distance and bearing on every row |
| **7 / 9** | previous / next pin, centring the map on it |
| **Back** | leave. Where you were looking is saved — also on power-off |

While the map is open the side buttons belong to it, not to the music player (the Game Boy
has the same rule), so zoom cannot silently turn into play/pause because a track is loaded.

The strip's message row grows to two rows when a message needs them — "No fix yet, and no pin
of your own to fall back on" used to end in `..` — and shrinks back at the next key (0.9.70).

The left soft key reads **Pin/Menu** because it does both: the pin under the crosshair if there
is one, the map menu if there is not. **Centre on me** means *this phone*; it falls through to
the reference place only as a last resort, and then the screen names it — a key labelled
"centre on me" that quietly lands on somebody else's camp has told you something false.

The same table is on the phone: **Menu → Keys and colours**.

## What the colours mean

| Mark | What it is |
|---|---|
| orange dot | one of your pins |
| yellow ring | one of your pins, shared with the mesh — hollow centre, so it is not a colour judgement |
| green gem | a place heard from the mesh (a Meshtastic waypoint — COVEY's map shares these) |
| cyan dot | somebody else's last position, with their name |
| grey dot | …the same, but over 30 minutes old, and it says how old |
| white ring | this phone, from a GPS fix under two minutes old |
| grey ring | …the same, but the fix is older than that, and it says how much older |
| white gem | this phone's manually declared pin |

A stale position is drawn grey **on purpose**. On foot, half an hour is far enough to be
somewhere else entirely, and a map that draws an old dot the same as a live one is lying by
omission. The same rule applies to **you**: `getGpsFix()` answers "there has ever been a fix",
so a phone that lost the sky under canopy would otherwise keep drawing a confident white ring
over where it was an hour ago. Past two minutes — the mesh service's own freshness bar, not a
second one invented for the map — your ring goes grey and wears its age.

**Names are dropped, never squashed.** Eight places plus twenty nodes on a 240×250 screen is
not hypothetical on a hunting channel, and unmanaged labels overprint into a grey smear. Names
are placed most-important-first — you, your pins, the mesh's places, then other people (starred
first) — and one that would land on another is not drawn. Its **marker** is still there, which
is the part that says where somebody is, and the name is on the Nodes list either way.

## Where it opens

1. Where you closed it last. That is the whole point of it, and it is the only one of these
   that works with no sky and no signal.
2. This phone's GPS fix, if the receiver is on and has one.
3. The mesh's reference place — a chosen waypoint, a fresh fix, or your declared pin,
   whichever the Meshtastic app's own precedence picks.
4. The middle of whatever tiles are actually on the card.
5. 0, 0 — with the map saying there is nothing to show.

## Pins, and what "share" means

A pin is a private mark on your own map: *park here*, *the gate*, *blood trail starts*. It
lives in a text file on the card (`/maps/pins.txt`), there can be 64 of them, and **nothing
about it reaches the air**.

**Share it on the mesh** turns that pin into a Meshtastic *waypoint*: it goes out on the
radio, appears on COVEY's map and on any Meshtastic device that shares the channel, and comes
back to this phone's own Places list. That is a deliberate act, every time, and:

- it prefers a **private** channel — a location on LongFast is readable by every Meshtastic
  radio in range;
- it is **locked to this node**, so nobody else's radio can move or delete it;
- the phone says whether it actually **reached the air**. "Saved, but NOT sent" means the
  radio was not ready and nobody else has it;
- renaming or moving a shared pin **re-sends it**, so the mesh never holds a stale copy;
- **Take it off the mesh** sends the deletion marker and removes it from other people's maps
  too. A camp that has moved is worse than no camp at all.

The mesh's own place table holds **eight** waypoints, shared with COVEY. Your 64 pins are
separate and unaffected — only shared ones take one of those eight slots.

## Stretching the most detailed tile there is

Nick: *"if the more detailed zoom levels don't exist, don't just let the higher zooms go
blank, just stretch the most detailed available tile and say what tile is being stretched and
by how much"* (0.9.78).

**Every tile position on the screen is drawn from the deepest level the card has there.** If
the position's own tile is missing, the map uses its parent's quarter, stretched 2x. If that
is missing too, it uses the grandparent's sixteenth, stretched 4x, and so on, down to the
area's shallowest level or 8 levels up, whichever comes first (past 8, a position would be
smaller than one pixel of the ancestor). The walk is per
position, so the edge of a download shows real tiles beside stretched ones instead of grey.
A real tile is never stretched. **A grey square means there is no tile at any level.**

Stretched is bigger, not sharper: the same ground detail in more pixels. The map says so
rather than let a fuzzy screen look like a fault:

- **the corner chip gets a star** (`z17*`) whenever any position on the screen is stretched;
- **the status chip names the stretched levels and their factors, deepest level first**, so
  each end of the range sits beside its own factor:
  - one level: `z16 tiles stretched 2x`, or `z13 tiles stretched 8x` at z16 where the card
    holds z13 and nothing deeper;
  - several: `z13-12 stretched 4-8x` at z15 means z13 at 4x and z12 at 8x;
  - `z16-14 x2-8` is the short form when the full one will not fit.

  Written the other way round, `z14-16 stretched 2-8x` would read as z14 at 2x. That is the
  one fact Nick asked to be told, told backwards;
- **`card read error`** on the status chip means a tile is on the card but the wrong length or
  unreadable. It is still drawn from its ancestor, but a failing card must not pass for
  ordinary stretching;
- the zoom step that goes **one level past an area's deepest tiles** says once *"Past the
  tiles: z16 stretched 2x. Same detail, bigger — and fuzzy."* The next press is refused with
  *"z17 is as close as this map goes, tiles and all"*.

**The scale bar stays honest.** It reads 50 m where z16 read 100 m, because the view really is
at z17; only the pixels are borrowed. Pins, the crosshair readout and "how far is that" are all
computed at the real zoom, so nothing on the screen is lying about distance.

The zoom STEP goes only one level past an area's deepest tiles (`MAP_OVERZOOM_MAX`): two levels
would be a screen of 64 fat squares, and nothing is learned from it. Filling a HOLE from
several levels up is different: that is not a zoom you chose, and the chip names the factor.
So an OpenTopoMap area holding z17 zooms to z18, and a USGS area stops at z17. The stretched
level is remembered across a power-off. It travels between map areas, but only ever one level
past *that* area's own deepest tiles.

While a tile is still being read off the card, the nearest shallower level already in memory
is drawn in its place and counted as stretched, so the chip is honest about that too. While a
download is writing into the area on the screen, the map checks it every 10 s, so a freshly
written tile replaces its stretched parent without a keypress. That includes a download
writing a level deeper than the area had when the map opened (the first z17 run over a z16
area): the map picks up the new level, draws it, and lets you zoom into it.

**COVEY does the same**, per source: OpenTopoMap views to z18 over its real z17, and USGS to
z17 over z16. Its info chip reads like `z18 · OpenTopo · z17 stretched 2x` or
`· z16-14 stretched 2-8x`. ⚠ The 0.9.77 version of this section said that online COVEY
"streams the real z17 tiles instead". That was only ever true for OpenTopoMap. Both USGS
services answer 404 at z17, so over USGS COVEY stretches z16 online and offline alike.

## The tiles

```
/maps/<area>/<z>/<x>/<y>.565
```

Standard slippy-map `z/x/y` numbering — the same numbering every tile downloader and every
`z/x/y` cache on a computer already uses, COVEY's included. `<area>` is whatever you want the
map called on the phone (letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`; at most 31 characters; not starting
with a dot). You can have several; the Maps menu lists them when there is more than one.

**A tile is 256×256 pixels, RGB565, little-endian, 131072 bytes exactly.** Raw. Not PNG, not
JPEG.

### Why raw, when raw is eight times bigger

The phone decodes nothing, and that is the design rather than a shortcut.

- There is **no PNG decoder** in this firmware. Adding one costs a vendored library plus
  contiguous internal RAM on a phone whose crashes are internal-heap fragmentation.
- The ESP32's ROM **JPEG decoder refuses greyscale outright** — that is why `jpeg_grey.cpp`
  exists at all (33 of 45 pictures in one test book were 1-component JPEGs).

So a map made of compressed tiles would work right up until the day it met a tile of the
wrong flavour, in the woods, with nothing on the screen to say what was wrong. Raw costs card
space and buys zero decode time, zero decoder memory, and exactly **one** failure mode:
*the file is not 131072 bytes*, which the phone checks in one comparison and reports.

It also means a PNG copied to the card without being converted is refused rather than drawn
as a screenful of confetti.

### What it costs on the card

A 20 × 20 km area at roughly 47° N:

| zoom | ground per pixel | tiles | size |
|---|---|---|---|
| z12 | ~26 m | ~9 | 1.2 MB |
| z13 | ~13 m | ~35 | 4.5 MB |
| z14 | ~6.5 m | ~130 | 17 MB |
| z15 | ~3.2 m | ~500 | 63 MB |
| z16 | ~1.6 m | ~2,400 | 300 MB |
| z17 (OpenTopoMap only) | ~0.8 m | ~9,600 | 1.2 GB |

About **85 MB for the whole stack to z15**, which is nothing on a 32 GB card. To z16 it is
~0.4 GB, and to z17 ~1.6 GB (the downloader's own count for 10 km around 47.5° N). z13–z15 is
the useful range on a 240×320 screen. USGS Topo's z16 is the z15 drawing scaled up, four
times the card space for ground you can already see. OpenTopoMap's z17 is a real drawing
(house numbers, footpaths). It is worth its 4x for a small area, not by default. **z17 exists
only for OpenTopoMap: USGS answers 404 past z16.**

## On the Mac: making the card

`tools/convert_tiles.py` converts a tile tree (or an `.mbtiles` file) into the format above.
It needs **nothing installed** — it uses Pillow when you have it and macOS's own `sips` when
you do not.

**The command**, with the card mounted and a tile tree in `~/covey-tiles`:

```bash
python3 tools/convert_tiles.py ~/covey-tiles /Volumes/WIPHONE/maps/home --zoom 12-15
```

Check the damage before committing to it:

```bash
python3 tools/convert_tiles.py ~/covey-tiles /Volumes/WIPHONE/maps/home --zoom 12-15 --dry-run
```

From an `.mbtiles` file instead (the script unpacks it; the phone never sees it):

```bash
python3 tools/convert_tiles.py camp.mbtiles /Volumes/WIPHONE/maps/camp --zoom 12-15
```

Re-running is cheap: tiles that are already there and the right length are left alone, so
adding a zoom level or a new corner of the map only converts what is new.

### Three things that bite

⚠ **Convert straight onto the card, or copy with `rsync`.** Finder writes a `._name` sidecar
next to every file it copies onto FAT32 — one per tile, thousands of them, which the phone
then has to skip through. The command above writes directly to the card and creates none. If
you must copy a converted tree:

```bash
rsync -a --exclude '._*' --exclude '.DS_Store' ~/tiles-565/ /Volumes/WIPHONE/maps/home/
dot_clean -m /Volumes/WIPHONE
```

⚠ **The card must be FAT32.** Same rule as everything else on this phone; see the README.
Eject it properly — `diskutil eject /Volumes/WIPHONE` — before pulling it, and swap cards
with the phone **off**.

⚠ **`.mbtiles` rows are upside down.** MBTiles counts rows from the south (TMS), slippy tiles
count from the north. The script flips them. If you unpack an `.mbtiles` with some other tool
and the map looks *almost* right but subtly wrong, that is what happened — and on forest it
is remarkably hard to see.

### Where tiles come from

Three ways, in the order you will probably use them:

1. **The phone downloads them itself** — `Menu → Download maps...` on the map, over WiFi.
   See the next section. This is the one that works with no computer in the loop.
2. **Push a converted tree from the Mac**, no card swapping: convert as above into any
   folder, then `python3 tools/wiphone_send.py --app maps --tree ~/tiles-565/home` sends it
   to `/maps/home/...` over the phone's own upload server (271 tiles, 34 MB: about ten
   minutes). The uploader's `maps` mode is the only one that accepts folder paths, and only
   `<area>/<z>/<x>/<y>.565` shaped ones. Two things to know: a tile that is already on the
   card at the right size is skipped (add `--replace` to push a re-converted tree, since every
   tile is the same size), and if Maps is OPEN while a tree arrives it may blacklist a tile it
   caught half-written — `Menu → Rescan the card` afterwards, or push with Maps closed. The
   same goes for `pins.txt`: push it with Maps closed, or the next pin edit writes over it.
3. **Straight onto the card**, as the commands above show.

A tile server's terms are between you and the server. USGS is public domain and asks for a
credit line. OpenTopoMap is CC-BY-SA, and its about page welcomes use as long as mass
downloads do not overburden its server. The phone waits 0.6 s after each OpenTopoMap tile and
says so on the help screen; both credits are printed there.

**z17 quadruples the requests**, so at z17 there is a **minimum of 2.0 s between the starts of
two OpenTopoMap requests**, on the phone and on COVEY. At z17 that interval IS the pace: a
real 2 km run on phone 2 measured 2,068 ms a z17 tile, while its z11-16 tiles took ~3.5-4 s. A
20 km area to z17 is ~51,000 requests (~38,000 of them at z17). A server that answers
429/502/503/504 gets the same tile retried after 60 s, doubling to 15 min, and the pace is
doubled for the rest of the run (capped at 10 s).

**z18 is never requested.** OpenTopoMap answers z18 with a 200 and a placeholder image reading
*"max zoom layer = 17"*: opaque text on a transparent background. ⚠ That is NOT caught by the
"fully transparent PNG = no tile" check (on the phone, on COVEY or in `convert_tiles.py`), so the
guard is that nothing ever asks for it. The phone's source ceiling for `otm` is z17, COVEY's
`TILE_ZMAX["otm"]` is 17, and `cardday.sh` never converts a z18 folder.

### Pooling the tiles of several devices

Two phones and a COVEY that each downloaded their own patches end up with three different
maps. The union of them is one tree of PNG originals on the Mac, `~/tiles-master`, and every
device gets the whole of it. The tree is the standard `<source>/<z>/<x>/<y>.png`, which is
COVEY's own layout. **Only COVEY's DOWNLOADED tiles go into the pool** (`/root/covey-tiles/<src>`).
Tiles it only STREAMED while panning live in a separate tree (`/root/covey-tiles-streamed`).
They stay on COVEY, marked as streamed and liable to expire when its card fills, and they
never reach the phones. A spot that exists only because it was streamed has to be downloaded
properly on COVEY before card day (below).

The phones need their **cards in the Mac's reader**: the union is 128 KB per tile, and a
hundred thousand tiles is ~13 GB — a week over the phone's WiFi uploader (measured 48–69 KB/s)
against under an hour onto a card. Nothing reads files off the phone over WiFi at all.

**Card day is `tools/cardday.sh`, in this order:**

```bash
# 0. THE EVENING BEFORE: the master's counts, and COVEY's streamed-only places.
#    Download those properly on COVEY (Map > DL > Streamed-only) or the phones will not get them.
tools/cardday.sh status

# 1. COVEY's DOWNLOADED tiles into the master (never its streamed ones; never overwrites)
tools/cardday.sh covey pull

# 2. each phone's OLD card, in the reader: a full backup, and its tiles into the master
#    (pull every phone before pushing any, so each card gets them all)
tools/cardday.sh phone1 pull /Volumes/WIPHONE1
tools/cardday.sh phone2 pull /Volumes/WIPHONE2

# 3. each NEW card: that phone's backup, then the WHOLE master
tools/cardday.sh phone1 push /Volumes/NEWCARD

# 4. and back to COVEY: whatever its downloaded tree lacks, over SSH
tools/cardday.sh covey push
```

🛑 **The old step 1 was `ssh covey 'sudo tar cf - -C /root/covey-tiles .' | tar xf - -C
~/tiles-master`. Do not use it.** `tar` overwrites by default, so it replaced master tiles
with whatever COVEY had. It also pulled the legacy root-level zoom folders and any half-written
`.part` files, and today it would pool streamed tiles as if they were downloaded.

**What `covey pull` does** (`tools/covey_pull.py`):
- It reads a manifest of COVEY's downloaded tree per source (`sudo find -printf`). It never
  names the streamed tree, the root-level digit folders or anything called `*-streamed`.
- Before anything moves, it prints COVEY's own streamed-only list (COVEY's `tilestore
  --places`) under *"Will NOT reach the phones unless downloaded on COVEY first:"*, one row per
  place with its tile count, zoom range, the date it was streamed, and how much of its deepest
  level the master already has. A place the master already covers completely (a phone's own
  download, a fetch on the Mac) is listed apart, because the phones get it anyway.
- **Without that report it refuses (exit 2).** A COVEY that cannot give it is most likely one
  whose streamed tiles still sit in the downloaded tree, and pulling them would put them on
  both phones as if chosen. `--without-report` overrides it, and is only for when COVEY's
  cut-over is known to be done.
- It stages the missing tiles in `~/tiles-master/.incoming/<src>`: a tar stream for a big zoom,
  and `rsync --files-from` passes to fill gaps. Each staged file must match COVEY's size
  exactly, be more than 0 bytes, AND end like a tile (a PNG's IEND chunk, a JPEG's FFD9). A
  file that fails is deleted from staging and fetched again. 🛑 The end check is not optional:
  when a tar stream stops mid-tile, bsdtar still pads that tile to the size in its header with
  zeros, so a cut tile is exactly COVEY's size. The tile bsdtar was writing when a stream
  stopped is dropped by name too.
- It links the verified tiles into the master with `os.link`, which fails when the name
  exists. **A master tile is never overwritten.**
- Its pass test is a set difference: every non-empty tile COVEY has must be in the master
  afterwards, non-empty (an empty master file where COVEY has a good tile fails it). It logs
  to `cardday.log` and writes the added paths to `covey_pulled_<date>.txt`. For a first run,
  try `python3 tools/covey_pull.py pull --dry-run` (manifests and counts only). The first real
  pull (2026-09-24, after COVEY's cut-over) added 250 tiles and ended with "0 on COVEY missing
  from the master"; openrsync's `--files-from` against COVEY worked.

**Zero-byte tiles are never pulled.** A 0-byte tile on COVEY is a failed fetch or a hard power
cut, not a map. It is listed in `~/tiles-master/covey_zero_bytes.txt`, and deleting it on COVEY
stays a deliberate act. On the way back, `tiles_565_to_png.py` treats a 0-byte master PNG as
absent and fills it, and `covey push` counts only non-empty tiles.

**What the other steps do:**
- **`cardday.sh status`** prints the master's per-source counts and, when COVEY answers, its
  streamed-only places (with how much of each the master already has) and its disk. Otherwise
  it prints "not reachable" and carries on.
- **`covey push`** writes only into COVEY's downloaded tree, with `rsync -rt` (so the files do
  not arrive owned by the Mac's uid). It skips a source that would leave COVEY under 4 GiB
  free.
- **The phone push** writes z0-16 for every source first, then z17, each after a free-space
  check against the card. It never writes z18. A card that fills up then loses only z17,
  never the whole of `usgs-img`/`usgs-topo`, which sort after `otm`.

The hand loops underneath, for reference:

```bash
tools/card_clone.sh pull /Volumes/WIPHONE ~/wiphone-cards/phone1          # the whole card
for a in ~/wiphone-cards/phone1/maps/*/; do                                # its tiles, as PNG
  python3 tools/tiles_565_to_png.py "$a" ~/tiles-master/$(basename "$a")   # --jpeg for usgs-img
done
tools/card_clone.sh push ~/wiphone-cards/phone1 /Volumes/NEWCARD           # onto a new card
for s in ~/tiles-master/*/; do
  python3 tools/convert_tiles.py "$s" /Volumes/NEWCARD/maps/$(basename "$s") --zoom 0-16
done                                                                       # then --zoom 17-17
```

The area name on the phone is the source's folder name (`usgs-topo`, `usgs-img`, `otm`), so
the same tile is the same file on all three devices and a re-run copies nothing twice:
`convert_tiles.py` keeps a tile that is already there at the right length, `tiles_565_to_png.py`
keeps a PNG that exists (unless it is 0 bytes), and `card_clone.sh` never deletes.
`convert_tiles.py` does ~300 tiles/s with numpy installed (`python3 -m pip install --user
numpy`); the card is the limit. It exits 1 when it stops early (a full or pulled card), so
`cardday.sh` stops too. It also refuses a fully transparent tile as unreadable rather than
flattening it into a solid square.

The pool on 2026-09-22 was **132,826 tiles, 16.2 GB on each phone**, with ~13 GB free on a
32 GB card. A 20 km OpenTopoMap area to z17 adds ~6.3 GB, so z17 fits, but it is a budget.

`tiles_565_to_png.py` is `convert_tiles.py` run backwards (5-6-5 bits replicated up to 8, so
white stays white); `tests/check_convert_tiles.py` holds the two to each other, because a tile
that goes phone → master → other phone passes through both. ⚠ COVEY's aerial tiles are JPEG
bytes under `.png` names (its downloader keeps whatever the server sent, and the map loads by
content) — `--jpeg` writes the same, at a third of the bytes of a true-colour PNG of a photo.

## Download maps on the phone

`Menu → Download maps...` fetches an area around the crosshair over WiFi and writes it to the
card in the raw format above, so the viewer never learns where a tile came from.

| Row | Choices |
|---|---|
| Source | **USGS Topo** (contours, roads, labels — the hunt map), **USGS Aerial**, **OpenTopoMap** (denser contours, CC-BY-SA, slow server). The form opens on the source of the map you are looking at |
| Radius | 2 / 5 / 10 / 20 km around the crosshair, at every depth |
| Detail | to z13, z14, z15 or z16, and **z17 for OpenTopoMap only** (`Detail: z17 (4x z16's cost)`). z15 is 3 m per pixel; USGS z16 is the same drawing scaled up and costs four times as much. USGS has no z17, so on USGS the row stops at z16, and a press never lands on a step that shows the same depth twice. The depth shown is the depth used |

The line under them is the honest estimate: tiles, size on the card, and time, e.g. `50451
tiles, 6.2 GB, up to about 36 h` (OpenTopoMap, 20 km, z17). It uses the rates measured on the
phone: USGS about a second a tile, OpenTopoMap about four to z16, and OpenTopoMap's z17 at the
2.0 s interval plus 0.1 s (phone 2 measured ~2.07 s). It says **"up to"** because tiles
already on the card are skipped in milliseconds. Over 4 h it adds `Keep it on USB: about 36 h
of downloading`; off USB the job would stop at the battery floor and wait.
**Start download** needs WiFi and either USB power or a battery above 3.8 V, and says which is
missing. It is also refused during a game, a Files folder job, or within a minute of a call.

While it runs, the screen shows THAT job, read-only:
- `Downloading 24 of 271`, the zoom level it is on, the bytes, the seconds and the failures;
- `About N left`, from the mean of the last 200 tiles fetched;
- `Server busy - trying again in N min` when the server has asked it to slow down;
- `Resumes by itself after a WiFi drop or a restart`.

Start is not offered until the job is stopped or finished: a new one would replace a job that
may be days old. **Stop takes two presses within 3 s.** The first says `Stopping forgets it: N
of M done, and it will not resume`. The second finishes the tile in hand and quits, and the
saved job is forgotten at once. The screen stays awake while you watch it, and lets go 2 min
after the last key. Leave it and the download carries on; the map's own tiles, the messages
and the clock all still work.

Re-running the same area only fetches what is missing. A tile is "there" only when it is
exactly 131072 bytes, so a power-off mid-tile leaves nothing the next run will not repair. When
a run is over the screen keeps its account (`Last run: 5517 new, 7332 already had, 4 failed,
7013 s`). If anything failed, it adds `Last problem:` with the last tile that did and why. Every
line on this screen **wraps** onto more rows rather than ending in `..` (0.9.68).

**A download is built to run for days (0.9.78).** A 20 km OpenTopoMap area to z17 is about 36
hours, and nothing that long happens without a WiFi drop, a call, a game or a restart:
- **The job is kept in NVS:** source, the WiFi network it started on, centre, radius, depth and
  a cursor, saved at most every 500 tiles, every 5 min, and at the end of each level. A job on
  the serial custom source is not kept.
- **A call or a game pauses it.** Past 10 min it stops instead.
- **A WiFi drop longer than 20 s stops it**, because the phone's WiFi rescue needs the RAM.
- **Off USB, below 3.75 V**, a running job stops.
- **A stopped job resumes by itself** when all of these hold:
  - the phone is back on **the same network** it started on, and has been for 60 s;
  - it is on USB, or the battery is at 3.8 V or more;
  - there has been no call for a minute;
  - no game is running and no Files folder job is running;
  - the card is in.
- **Cool-downs:** after a failure stop (the network gave up, nothing decoded, no RAM) it waits
  10, 20, then 40 min, then retries every 60 min (`Retrying in N min (the network gave up)`).
  **After 26 failure stops or refused starts in a row without one new tile (about a day of
  cool-downs) it gives up** and says so (`Stopped resuming: a day of retries without one new
  tile`). Time spent waiting at a gate, on another network or off USB, is not retrying and
  does not count. A card that keeps refusing writes never resumes by itself.
- **Crash strikes:** three restarts during boot resumes (a resume that neither ended in a
  recorded stop nor wrote 50 new tiles) stop the resuming: `Stopped resuming: the phone
  restarted 3 times during this download`. Switching the phone off (the held power button or
  the low-battery cut) and **Restart** from the menu are not crashes: each saves the live
  cursor and records a clean stop first. A reset from the cable, a reflash or a panic does
  count. Proven on phone 2: an esptool reset mid-run came back as `resumed the otm download at
  z16 #1 (pass 1, 217 written, strike 1)`, and the strike cleared after 50 new tiles.
- **On another network** it waits: `Paused: resumes on <network>, where it started`. On a trip
  the network is often a phone's hotspot, on somebody's data plan, so the phone never does
  that by itself. The form offers **Resume on this network**, which moves the job to the
  current one. A job waiting for any other reason (a give-up, a cool-down) gets **Resume it
  now**. A manual resume never counts a strike, and a refused one says why.
- **The order is centre-out.** Within each level the tiles go centre-out in 16×16 blocks,
  starting at z11, so a run cut short still holds the middle of the area. At the end of a run
  that was not stopped, **one automatic second pass** retries what did not land.
- **Card space.** A resume checks card space only for the tiles at or past the cursor that
  the job has not written, keeping max(256 MB, 2 % of the card) spare. If there is not enough
  room, the job is KEPT and stops resuming: `Stopped: no room on the card for the rest - free
  some, then Resume`.

The Files app refuses to delete or move a folder at or above the `/maps/<src>` of a download
that is running or waiting to resume.

**What counts as a tile:**
- **No tile:** HTTP 404 or 410, or a PNG whose every pixel is transparent. Either is counted
  and skipped, and nothing is written.
- **A failure:** a 200 that does not decode as a tile (a captive portal's login page, a
  truncated body). Twelve in a row stop the run, and it then resumes under the cool-downs
  above.

⚠ OpenTopoMap's z18 placeholder is not fully transparent (see above). The guard against it is
that the phone never asks for z18.

`card refused the write` is the card saying no to one tile's 128 KB: a short write from the
SD layer, usually one busy timeout on a card that is otherwise fine (phone 2 lost 4 tiles of
12,853 to it). A refused write is tried again after 200 ms, 1 s and 3 s before it counts
(0.9.68 tried once; 0.9.74 made it three). A tile that still fails is simply missing, and
**Start download** again fetches only the missing ones. A card that refuses twelve tiles in a
row stops the run, because that is a full or pulled card, and that stop never resumes by
itself.

Each source is its own area on the card (`/maps/usgs-topo`, `/maps/usgs-img`, `/maps/otm`);
`Map area:` in the menu switches between them, as does the bottom side button. An area the
downloader did not make — `home`, the tiles converted on the computer with
`tools/convert_tiles.py` — is a map too, just one the downloader cannot add to.

**Where a map's tiles are.** An area that is not where you are looking is indistinguishable
from an empty one — grey squares either way — so since 0.9.71 the phone reads each area's
extent once when Maps opens (the folder names at its coarsest zoom: three small directory
listings) and says so: switching onto a map whose tiles are elsewhere puts `Map: home (z11-15)
- its tiles are 35km NW of here` on the strip, and every row of **Map area** ends with `here`
or the distance and bearing to that map's tiles from the crosshair. Serial `maps` prints each
area's box in degrees. It is a bounding box, so an L-shaped download reads as its enclosing
rectangle. Deleting an area is a job for the computer: remove `/maps/<area>` from the card.

What it costs (measured on WiPhone 2, 2026-09-18):

| Area | Tiles | On the card | USGS Topo | OpenTopoMap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 km, z11–15 | ~55 | 7 MB | ~1 min | ~4 min |
| 5 km, z11–15 | ~270 | 34 MB | ~4.5 min | ~18 min |
| 10 km, z11–15 | ~865 | 113 MB | ~15 min | ~1 h |
| 20 km, z11–15 | ~3,260 | 427 MB | ~1 h | ~3.5 h |

OpenTopoMap to z17, computed with the phone's own count and rates (tileFetchEstimate's square
at 47.5° N; 4.0 s a tile to z16, and 2.1 s at z17, the 2.0 s interval plus 0.1 s). The count
moves a little with where you stand, and the Download form shows the exact figure for the
crosshair:

| Area | Tiles | On the card | OpenTopoMap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 km, z11–17 | ~570 | 70 MB | ~25 min |
| 5 km, z11–17 | ~3,400 | 424 MB | ~2.5 h |
| 10 km, z11–17 | ~12,900 | 1.6 GB | ~9 h |
| 20 km, z11–17 | ~51,000 | 6.2–6.3 GB | ~36–37 h |

Measured (phone 2, 2026-09-23): a real 2 km run was 567 tiles (555 new, 12 already there), 0
failed, in 1,243 s (21 min). z17 went at 2,068 ms a tile and z11–16 at ~3.5–4 s. The internal
largest block never fell below 49,616 B.

Each level is 4x the one above it, so ~three quarters of any z17 area is the z17 level itself.
z17 is for a hunt area and its approaches; 20 km of it is the overnight-and-then-some case
Nick asked for (*"overnight downloads or multi day downloads even pre-trips"*).

### How it works, and why it took a night to make it work

The phone had never opened an HTTPS connection: the framework builds mbedTLS to allocate from
**internal** RAM, its two 16 KB record buffers alone exceed the phone's largest free block, and
the handshake runs on the calling task's 8 KB stack. `tile_fetch.h` has the whole story. The
short version: the downloader runs on its own task with an 8 KB stack, redirects mbedTLS's
allocator into PSRAM once (`mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free`), keeps one connection alive for
the whole area, decodes each tile with the decoders already in the ESP32's ROM (TJpgDec for
USGS's JPEG, the `tinfl` inflater for OpenTopoMap's PNG — `tile_png.cpp` is the 300 lines of
PNG around it, proven against 52 host checks), and writes the raw file to a temporary name
before renaming it into place.

Internal RAM is the thing to watch: the task's stack is 8 KB for the life of the firmware
from the first download (a real z17 run left 4,572 of its 8,192 bytes never touched: `task
stack floor 4572 of 8192`), and the first TLS handshake of a run dips the internal heap by
another ~12 KB for a second or two. The downloader refuses to start when the largest free
block is under 14 KB (24 KB before the stack exists) and tells you to reboot first. The
serial console has the numbers: `maps dl` prints the run's heap floor and the task's stack
high-water mark.

### From the console

```
maps dl                                  what the last / current run did, with the heap floor,
                                         the stack floor, ms a tile, and the saved job's resume
                                         state (network, cursor, strikes, last stop reason)

                                         and the start line prints the depth actually used.
                                         The job is kept and resumes by itself
maps dl stop                             finish the tile in hand and quit; the job is

## Checking it worked, without pressing anything

A map's failure mode is showing the **wrong ground**, and that looks exactly like showing the
right ground — no screenshot can tell a tile tree that is one column out from a correct one.
So the serial console can drive the whole thing:

```
maps                          what the card holds, the saved view, the pins file
maps goto 47.6062 -122.3321 15 home     set where Maps opens next
```

`maps goto` writes the same saved view the app itself writes, so you can put a known
coordinate in over the cable, open the app, and compare the screen against a map on the
computer. `tools/shot.py` will take the screenshot.

## What it costs the phone

- **Since 0.9.74 the whole phone has ~40 KB more internal RAM** (the SDK's unused Bluetooth
  reserve, released at boot — CHANGELOG 0.9.74), so the numbers below that say "~19 KB" or
  "~25 KB" of internal heap describe the phones as they were when measured; idle is ~66 KB now
  and a download bottoms out near 48 KB. The downloader's 14 KB handshake bar is unchanged;
  when it cannot be met the Download screen and `maps dl` now print how far short the phone is.
- **768 KB of PSRAM** while the app is open (six 128 KB tile slots), allocated once and freed
  on the way out. PSRAM runs ~3.6 MB free; internal RAM — the ~19 KB that SIP and WiFi fight
  over — is untouched by the viewer. The downloader is the exception: see above.
- **A tile arrives in 32 KB pieces**, one per 25 ms tick, because a 128 KB SD read is
  100–250 ms and everything in this firmware shares one task. 250 ms is exactly the threshold
  the superloop's stall detector was built to complain about; four tiles read the obvious way
  is a second of frozen phone, a dropped WiFi connection and some eaten keypresses, every
  time you pan. While a tile has not arrived, a shallower level already in memory is drawn
  stretched in its place (and the chip says so); with nothing to stretch, it is a
  plainly-marked grey square.
- **No timer at all** once the screen is painted. A map that is finished must not keep the
  CPU awake.
