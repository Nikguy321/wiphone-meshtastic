# Changelog

## Unreleased — stability

A day spent on the phone restarting by itself. The cause is now identified and
fixed, a settings screen that had been quietly broken works again, and the tools
for reading what the phone was doing no longer make the problem worse.

### 🔁 The random restarts

- **The likely cause is fixed.** Every time the phone tried to join WiFi it
  registered another copy of its network event handler, and never removed any of
  them. Out of range it retries every 20 seconds, so a drive with no signal
  stacked up hundreds of copies — one measured journey was 143 minutes without
  service, which is around 430. The moment signal came back, **all** of them ran
  at once, each tearing down and rebuilding the same network buffers. That churn
  breaks the phone's small pool of working memory into fragments until something
  eventually cannot find the unbroken space it needs, and the phone reboots.
  It is registered once now, when the phone starts, instead of on every attempt.

- **The phone can now say why it restarted, and it has been answered.** Four
  restarts were captured and every one of them was a crash — not a flat battery,
  not a stall, not the power being interrupted. The battery never dropped below
  3.99 V across the whole record, which rules that out entirely.

- ⚠ **This is a strong candidate, not a proven cure.** The proof is time: several
  days of normal use, with the phone going in and out of signal, and no restart.
  Worth keeping an eye on rather than assuming it is done.

### 🧭 Settings

- **Settings > WiFi auto-switch works again.** It was showing the Music icon, and
  choosing it opened the Music player instead of the toggle — so the screen was
  effectively unreachable. The two entries had been given the same internal ID and
  the menu picks the first match, so the WiFi row was standing in for Music.
  Renumbered.

- **The phone now checks its own menu for repeated IDs when it starts.** The same
  mistake had already shipped once before, as "Music opens Books", and was fixed
  in a way that moved the clash rather than removing it. Nothing was watching for
  it, so now something is.

### 🩺 Diagnostics

- **The health log can be read without disturbing what it measures.** Pulling the
  whole file kept truncating, and a truncated read loses the *end* — which is
  exactly where the reason for the last restart is written. Retrying was worse
  than the problem: around thirty fetches, each its own connection, on a phone
  whose scarcest resource is the memory all of that consumes. It can now hand back
  just the most recent part, so one request gets what matters.

## 2026-08-14 — Music player, e-reader, real battery life, and working firmware updates

The biggest release so far. Two whole new apps, a serious pass on power, and the
over-the-air updater brought back from the dead and pointed at this repo.

### 🎵 Music player (new)
- **Plays MP3 and WAV straight from the SD card** — no converting anything.
  Menu > Music. Stereo through the headphone jack, mono to the loudspeaker
  otherwise, and it follows the jack live: unplug mid-song and it carries on out
  of the speaker from the same place.
- **The four side buttons are the transport**, from the top: play/pause, next
  (**hold** for previous), volume up, volume down. Holding "previous" behaves
  like any music player — within 3 seconds it goes back a track, after that it
  restarts the current one.
- **Playback keeps going when you leave the screen.** Read a book or check the
  mesh with music playing; tracks advance on their own.
- Shuffle and repeat (off / all / one), a library scanned from `/music`,
  `/books`, `/roms` and the card root, and its **own WiFi uploader**.
- **Volume starts low** (−18 dB) and is remembered until the phone restarts. It
  is deliberately separate from the call volume, so a quiet album can never
  leave you unable to hear the next phone call.
- Pausing and playing **resumes where you were** rather than restarting.

### 📖 E-reader (new)
- **Reads EPUB and plain text from the card**, with pictures inline. Menu >
  Books.
- **Your place is saved** and survives the phone losing power at any instant.
  Position is stored as (chapter, character offset), not a page number, so it
  still means something after a font-size change — and on a different device.
- **Greyscale JPEGs decode**, which the ESP32's built-in decoder cannot do
  (it is 3-component only, and most book art is 1-component).
- **Book sync over LoRa** — share your reading position with another device on a
  private channel. Jumps are confirmed, never taken silently.

### 🔋 Battery life
- **The phone now idles.** The main loop used to spin flat out at 240 MHz
  forever, screen off, doing nothing. It now sleeps between passes.
- **The CPU drops to 80 MHz when nothing is happening** and returns to 240 the
  moment the screen comes on, music plays, a call starts, the emulator runs or
  an upload begins.
- **WiFi modem sleep is on.** The receiver used to stay powered continuously;
  it now parks between beacons. Nothing is missed — buffered traffic still
  arrives, a fraction of a second later.
- **Scanning backs off when there is nothing to join.** Out of range, it used to
  scan every 2 minutes forever; now it eases to 5 after a sustained absence, and
  snaps back the moment anything connects.

### 🛠 Diagnostics
- **The phone records why it restarted.** The reset reason (crash, watchdog,
  brownout, or a normal power-on) is logged at boot, which turns "it rebooted
  again" into a specific answer.
- **A health line every minute** — free memory, the lowest it has ever been,
  largest free block, battery, CPU speed — written to `/health.log` on the card
  so it survives both a reboot and being unplugged.
- **Read it over WiFi** at `http://wiphone.local/log` with an upload screen open.

### 📤 File transfers
- **The upload page works on a phone now.** It was built around drag-and-drop,
  which does not exist on a touch screen; there is a proper "Choose files"
  button, and the file picker no longer greys everything out.
- **It stops after one page load — fixed.** The server kept the single
  connection slot occupied, so nothing loaded again until it was restarted.
- **Opening an uploader no longer knocks the phone off WiFi.** If the radio was
  still associating it would tear the connection down and host its own network
  instead; and on the way out it never reconnected.
- **Uploads are faster and retry themselves** — a weak link no longer means
  starting over by hand.
- **The screen stays awake while a server is running**, so a long transfer does
  not go dark halfway and look like a crash.

### ⬆️ Firmware updates over the air
- **Settings > Firmware settings works again**, and now points at this repo.
- It was not a dead link: the certificate the phone pinned **expired in April
  2021**, so every check failed the TLS handshake regardless of the URL. It now
  trusts a proper root certificate (valid to 2035) instead of a pinned leaf.
- Releases are published from `ota/` in this repo; `tools/publish_ota.sh` builds
  the binary, writes the manifest and bumps the version together.

### Known issues
- **Slight crackle in music playback.** Much improved — the decoder used to be
  rate-limited so it could never catch up after any interruption — but not
  entirely gone. The now-playing screen shows a `gaps:` counter to help pin it
  down.
- **No seeking within a track**, and no track/artist tags: the library lists
  filenames.

## 2026-07-09 — Reliable menu input, forgiving screen-off, working WiFi auto-switch

### Input
- **Menus register one press per press.** Buttons no longer double-fire, and
  holding the d-pad no longer auto-scrolls the menu — UI key events are now
  strictly edge-triggered (one event per physical press, re-armed only by a
  real release). The Game Boy emulator's input path is untouched.
- **Triple-tap-to-sleep is easy now** — three taps of the top-right button
  with up to ½ second between them (was a near-impossible fixed 0.7 s window
  for all three).

### WiFi
- **Auto-switch actually works.** It reliably scans and connects to the
  strongest saved network now (previously it could sit disconnected
  indefinitely). It also scans more often while disconnected (every 2 minutes)
  so it finds a network without waiting.

## 2026-07-07 — Game Boy polish, big-ROM support, WiFi auto-switch, input reliability

### Game Boy emulator
- **Sound!** The emulated Game Boy APU plays through the phone's speaker
  (32 kHz stereo over I2S). The **top two side keys** adjust volume in-game.
  Audio can never slow the game down: if the audio path misbehaves, the game
  drops sound and keeps running at full speed.
- **Full speed on heavy games** — even demanding Game Boy Color titles
  (e.g. Resident Evil Gaiden: 44% → ~100%). How: removed a PSRAM silicon
  workaround the phone's rev-3 chip doesn't need, hot emulator paths moved to
  zero-wait IRAM, `-O2/-O3` on the emulator core, cache-friendly screen
  blitting, and adaptive frameskip (heavy scenes drop *display* frames, never
  game speed).
- **Big ROMs (4 MB carts) now playable** — ROMs too large to hold in RAM are
  streamed from the SD card in 16 KB banks on demand.
- **Save states fixed** — saving used to reboot the phone (a task stack was
  4× smaller than intended).
- **Transfer ROMs & Help moved into the Game Boy app** — top two rows of the
  game list. The help screen documents controls and everything else.
- **Multi-file ROM upload fixed** — dropping several ROMs at once used to
  reboot the phone (RAM starvation + watchdog); uploads now go one-per-request
  with per-file progress, and the transfer screen frees the emulator's memory
  and the unused Bluetooth reserve before serving.
- **Reliable buttons** — held directions no longer stutter or stick: fixed a
  keypad-handler bug that wiped held keys, added I2C error retry, periodic
  FIFO draining, and a 40 ms hardware "still pressed" heartbeat so a lost
  release un-sticks in a third of a second.
- Long ROM names marquee-scroll in the picker; honest error screens (a ROM
  that can't load no longer silently launches the built-in game).

### Phone
- **WiFi auto-switch** — the phone periodically scans (battery-friendly, async)
  and hops to the strongest *saved* network; if the screen wakes with no
  connection it scans immediately. Only switches when meaningfully stronger
  (10 dB hysteresis). Toggle under **Settings → WiFi auto-switch**.
- **Status bar shows the connected network name** (small text, auto-shortened).
- **"Edit current network" no longer freezes** — a toggle handler ran on every
  keystroke and blocked 5 s reconnecting each time.
- Pressing End during a game no longer triggers the phone's call/hang-up UI.

## 2026-07-05 — Meshtastic: channels, relaying, unread counts

- Multiple channels with AES-128/256; import channels from a Meshtastic share
  link fully offline (apply from a received DM).
- Mesh client role: relays other nodes' packets (flood routing) to extend range.
- Configurable hop limit; per-chat unread counts; status-bar unread icon.
- Game Boy Color emulator first milestones: playable → full-speed dual-core,
  ROM picker, WiFi ROM transfer, save states, pause menu, 1:1/Fill scaling.

## 2026-07-04 — Initial public release

- PlatformIO build of the stock WiPhone firmware (Arduino-IDE only upstream).
- Meshtastic on the WiPhone's SX1276 LoRa radio: two-way encrypted text with
  standard Meshtastic nodes on LongFast (US), chats/threads UI, direct
  messages, node names, persistent history, notifications (icon, popup, sound,
  vibration), editable node name, low-power green/black theme.
